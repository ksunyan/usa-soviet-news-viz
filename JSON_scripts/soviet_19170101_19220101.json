In spite of the blockade and the un\nceasing war aganst it, Soviet Russia has succed\ned in improving the conditions under which the\nworkers and peasants live.

They matched their power\nagainst the League of Nations, and thus far havo\nwon.\nDanzig was a German city before the signing\nof the treaty of Versailes. The four autocrats,\nLloyd George, Clemenceau, Wilson and Orlando,\ndecided that the Poles must have an outlet to .the\nsea. In order to give them that a strip of Ger\nmany's territory was made into a Polish \"corri\ndor,\" running to Danzig. Danzig itself was created\na \"free\" city, which was to adopt its own consti\ntution and establish a government of its own.\nPoland was guaranteed certain rights to use the\ndocks and railroads.\nUntil the establishment of the government of\nDanzig through a constitutional convention a\nrepresentative of the League of Nations was made\ngovernor general of the city.\nThe munitions which the Poles received for\ntheir attack on Soviet Russia were largely de\nlivered through Danzig. When the Polish of\nfensive broke down before Soviet Russia's heroic\nRed Army and the Poles were first swept out of\nRussia ahd then back to the very gates of War\nsaw, all the capitalist nations, which had incited\nthe attack upon Soviet Russia, began to rush sup\nplies of munitions to the Poles.\nDanzig was the port of entry for Poland. Here\ncame French, English and American ships loaded\nwith rifles, cannons, machine guns, gassing ma\nchines ahd all the modem machinery for conduct\ning the work of killing human beings efficiently.\nHere also came ships loaded with Polish reservists\nfrom other countries.\nAll the aid which could be given Poland with\nout openly flouting in the face of the workers of\nthe capitalist nations the fact that such help\nwas being given was hurried forward. And the\nIrt through which all this help was to reach the\nPoles waz Danzig ! ,\nNaloialiy the capitalist nations thought that\neverything would go smoothly at Danzig. Had\nthey not made that place a \"free\" city? Was not\na representative of the League of Nations its\ngtftferttor-fcetleral? Were not French, English,\nz ig!\nLyons.\nItalian and possibly American troops its garrison?\nHow could there be any difficulty in assuring\nthe Poles the right to import munistions through\nthis \"free\" city under these conditions?\nBut we are living in the days when it is be\ncoming a ease of the capitalist governments pro\nposing and the workers disposing.\nAnd the workers of Danzig were not disposed\nto allow that port to be used to give aid to the\nenemies of Soviet Russia!\nFut how were the workers of Danzig to pre\nvent the Allied capitalist nations from using their\ncity to aid the Poles? There was the ruler of the\ncity the representative of the League of Nations!\nThere were the soldiers of various capitalist na\ntions! There were the English, French and Amer\nican warships in the harbor! How could the work\nera cope with these?\nThey found a way. They took a lesson from\nthe experience of Russia. They organized a Soviet\na Workers Council.\nThis Soviet declared that no aid for the Poles\nshould go t'n rough Danzig. All workers employed\non the docks and railroads which had to be used\nto move the munitions and men were ordered to\nstrike rather than in the slightest aid the enemies\nof Soviet Russia.\nNo munitions or men went through Danzig!\nEngland and France fumed. They and the\nUnited States sent more warships.\nBut no aid has gone through Danzig.\nThe governor-general says that unless he has\ntwenty thousand soldiers to land munitions and\nsupplies it will only mean that these will fall in the\nhands of the workers of Danzig.\nThus far the workers of Danzig have won.\nThrough the Workers Council, in which the power\nof the workers was organized they have success\nfully defied the League of Notions and the great\ncapitalist nations whose agent it is. They have\nused the form of organization which mobilizes the\nwhole power of the working class and which all\nworkers will learn to use in the struggle against\nthe exploitation and oppression by the capitalists.\nHail to the workers of Danzig!\ni"}, "4": {"url": "https://chroniclingamerica.loc.gov/lccn/sn88086023/1920-09-25/ed-2/seq-20.json", "date": "19200925", "ocr_eng": "Pendleton, Oregon, Saturday, September 25, 1020\nLET 'ER BUCK\n7\nE IN SOVIET RUSSIA HAVE NO SUCH FREEDOM AS IN DEMOCRATIC AMERICA TODAY\nCongressman Trench of Idaho Has prepared Data Showing Delusion Connected With Bolsheviki Rule.\nEast Orejonian Ronnd-Up Souvenir Edition\nf\nPBOPL\n3 j 1\nThorn has been no much dlncun-1 vote for member of the dtatrlct mral.\nIon of the Kumian Bovlct ayaiem soviet, who In turn vote for memliers\nof Government and mo Utile real i of the provincial soviet.

The offi&ers of the ;\nformer imperial Russian 4 rmy were i\nforced to enter the Red aroiy by the j\nSoviet Governmei>i. They mi de them- (\nshelves sure of these officers Wy retain- ,\nlug their families as hostages. i\nIt is not probable that for svme time i\nto come the Soviet Governnusnt will\nbe cast away by the Russian people i\nthemselves. The Soviet Government J\nItself cannot change in Its chwacter.\nIf the Soviet Government were* to dl- .\nm'nlsh in the lea?? riperep only the t\nterror which it has exercised for years\nalready, then the fury of the Russian\npeople against the Soviet Government\nwould soon show Itself openly. Iti ris\nriot at all In the interest of the Sov1**\nGovernment to remove the economic\ndistress in Russia. An improvement\nof the conditions of life tn Russia woul.3\nshake the reliability of the Red sraf,\nbecause the soldiers could then hope\nto find tolerable conditions also outside\ntho army. The system of the Soviet\nGovernment therefore excludes an \"i\neconomic reconstruction of Russia In\ncitber way.\nOn the other hand. Europe needs the .\neconomic reconstruction of Russia and (\nher relnstalment into the European .\neconomic body because the permanent ,\nloss of the Russian import and export '\nwill press heavily upon the life condl- 1\ntions of the European peoples, and all ?\nthe more so the longer It lasts. Hence (\nit fqllows that the European peoples ;\nwill be compelled in not too far a time .\nto remove 'by force of arms, if not ,\notherwise possible, a government whose\nexistence alone makes the relnstal\nment of Russia into the European\neconomic body an impossibUity, and\nconsequently the distress of Europe\nirreparable.\nDeceiving; the Workmen.\nThe fact that the Soviet Government\nwere alile to make ttie workmen of the\nEuropean peoples believe in their being\na government for the working people.\nthis fact, along with some other less im\nportant obstacles, stood in the way of\nan 'extensive action against the Soviet\nGovernment. The truth Is that In no\ntime of history and under no system\nof government the workmen of a nation |\nhad to endure gr-ater want of freedom\nand greater suffering than under the\nrule of the Soviet Government. The |\ndeception of the European workir-en ;\nft bout the character of the Soviet Gov\n??mment cannot last forever. Sooner\nor later unquestionable news from Rus- i\n*la must penetrate.\nThe Soviet Government for tnis\nreason must endeavor to gain a position\nhrfore that time, which, also from a\nmilitary point of view, appears uncon\nquerable. They would have got that\nposition In Europe In succeeding to ad\nvance their power toward the west,\nperhaps a* far a* the Rhine 11nr*. u'\nSoviet Government must, therefore, re\nmain in the offensive till they have |\nrealized this plan But onre having i\ngot as far, they will most probably push [\ntheir offensive Still more westward.\nThis is to be expected because the li>ad- |\n< rs of the Soviet Government declare |\npublicly that th-y Intend to spread the :\nSoviet system all over the world.\nThe means of attack of th- Soviet Gov\nernment are not at all exclusively mili\ntary The Soviet Government begins\nUs systematlo offensive rather by\nHclting the peoples against their_ gov\nernments. For thin purpose the Soviet\nGovernment uses numerous and ex\ntremely clever agents. The more the\neconomic distress of Europe proves lr\nrnparnhle. the more susceptible become\nthe European people* and with them trie\nEuropean armies to the propaganda of\nthe soviet Government\nThe degree of Bolshevist\nr ftenslve Is the formation of Bolshevist\norganizations In those countries ??sln?t\nwhich the offensives of the Soviet Gov\nernment ar- directed. At the earn* time\nV\" Soviet Government trl^s with nll\\pos\nrtbte means to get the railway and *ele\ngr%Vh officials in thoae countries on their\nSide, because In a given ease the mili\ntary transports depend upon their atti\ntude These preparations being com\npleted. the Soviet Government proceeds\nto a conclusive military attack.\nAccording to western European na\ntions the troops of the Moscow Soviet\nGovernment are Inferior, in spite of the\nIron discipline applied to them by the\nSoviet Government As to equipment\nthey do not come up to that of the\niv.'iitern European troope either. But\nthey suffice for their task If their oppo\nnents, highly qualified from a military\npoint of view, have been affected and\npermeated by the Bolshevist spirit and if\nthese opponents are threatened in the\nrear by partisans of the Soviet Govern\nment.\nHence it follows that Bolshevist offen\nsives against countries, the conquest of\nwhich the Soviet Government aims at,\nare not checked by peace treaties; the\nfact of peace conditions between the\nSoviet Government and a country to be\nconquered by It does not interfere with\nthe Bolshevist propaganda and the for\nmation of Bolshevist organizations in\nthat country, but rather facilitates them.\nThe Bolshevist offensives go on also\nduring peace.\nIn tills connection stress must be laid\nupon the fact that the 8ovtet Govern\nment in paragraph 2 of the peace treaty\nof Brest-Lltovsk had promised to stop\nevery kind of propaganda In Germany\nIt could be proved that the Ambassador\nof the Soviet Government in Berlin had\norganized Bolshevist revolts In Ger\nmany. His work was facilitated by the\npressure which the continual war In\nflicted upon the German people. A simi\nlar although weaker pressure on the\nwestern European peoples is now exer\ncised In spite of peace conditions\nthrough the continual economic distress\nof Europe. The Bolshevistic propaganda\namong the western European peoples\nwill, therefore, work slower than in\nGermany durlug the year 1918, but will\nprobably advance in spite of It.\nFrom a miTltary point of view the\nyear 1920 closos with a favorable final\nresult for the 'Soviet Government. In\nthe first Instance the Soviet Government\nsucceeded in destroying the army of\nDcniklnc. On the other hand the offen\nsive of the Soviet Government against\nPoland failed just near Warsaw, al\nthough having bi:en successful at first\nBut the Soviet Government got over\ntills reverse by entering into peace nego\ntiations with Poland. Owing to these\npeace negotiations the Soviet Govern\nment could bring considerable forces to\nbear n rnlnst Gen. Wrangel, who had\nreformed the retrains of the army of\nDeniklne in the south of Russia. In\ntha* way the Soviet Government suc\nceeded in completely defeating Gen.\nWrwngel.\n\"With the a?my of Wrangel the last\nan ti-Bolshevistic bodies of troops have\ndisappeared frcem the soil of European\nRussia, so that the Soviet Government\ncan attain draw up forces against\nPoland. It is Impossible to foresee\nhow far Poland wi* be able to resist\ni new offensive of the Soviet Govern\n?nent In consequence of the war\nin the summer of 13S0 large part* of\nPolish terrltoxy wore not cultivated,\nrhe economic distress of Poland must,\ntherefore. Increase, and all the more so\nis Poland is the scene of war already\nsince 1914 The Polish population has\naccordingly become more discontented.\nIntrlgn**!

The roll*h\nfinances have grown worse during the\nlast yiear. The arrry Is said to be less\nAt for* battle than at the beginning of\n19-0. And! there, la neavs about Bol\nshevist disturbances In Warsaw and\nother Polls* towns. In spite of all this\nit Is not Impossible that Poland' will\nalso resist successfully this time. But\nshould this be the case the Soviet Gov\nernment would continue the fight in\nshort intervals till sooner or later the\nstrength of Poland must be exhausted.\nShould\\Pr?land break down, the further\nadvance of the Bolshevist\nwould ho ritiier directed against Czecho\nslovakia and Rumania, or Ger\nmany. \" is difficult to foretell which of\nbotn ways the Soviet Government will\nchoose, hecausc .it cannot be ascertained\nfrom here how far the Bolshevistic\npreparations in Czecho-Slovakla and in\nRumania hi?ve< advanced. But It is\nprobable that *fter a breakdown of\nPoland the Bolshevist, offensive will be\nfirst directed against Germany. The\nreason for this in that a successiul at\ntack of the Soviet Government on\nCzechoslovakia and Rumania mi^nt in\nduce the Entente to acm Germany for\nthe tight against the Soviet Govern\nment The Soviet Government would\ntherefore, be more on the safe side> if\nthev succeeded In conquering north ami\ncmitral Gerrr-any first and afterward\nattack Czeeho-Slovakla. and Rumania.\nEor this reason It Is necessary to in\nvestigate what possibilities are given in\nGermany to resist such an attack. Tn\nthe way -of armed force Germany dis\nposes of the \"Reichswdhr, that will\nbe reduced to 100.000 rnen and a cer\ntain numb: r of local ^,e?

German east\nfrontier. Sirch a menace would he all\nthe more serious, as the German east\nfrontier can hardly he defended. The\nGerman Government, anyway, could try\nto draw up the greatest part of the\n\"Relch.wohr\" at the German east fron\ntier : but thon It would abandon the In\nterior of the country almost unpro\ntected to the axmed Communists' or\nganizations. who might at the same time\nthreaten in the rear the \"Relchswehr\"\ndrawn up at the German met frontier.\nIt Is Impossible to foresee how far a\nconcentration toward the East can he\ndisturbed by the Influence of the Bolahe\nvlst propaganda upon the German rail\nway officials and by single determined\nacts of sabotage to the railway trans\nports. But In case the German Govern\nment would keep the \"Relchswehr In\nthe Interior of the country and doe* not\ndraw It up at the esst frontier, the Ger\nman frontiers will be open to the undis\nturbed marching In of the Soviet Gov\nernment and these armies will then he\nin the position to Join the armed com\nmunistic organizations In Germany.\nIt follows from alt this that north and\ncentral Germany with the actual mean\"\nof d?fenee of the German Government\ncan linrdly be defended against Com\nmunism. hut that with a collapse \"' Po\nland at an offensive of the Soviet Gov\nernment nsalnst Germany it must be\nreckoned with the almost Inevitable loss\nof northern and central Germany and\nwith the conquest of this territory hy\nthe Soviet Government. I want to cm\nphaslz- the fact that the fitting ca\npacity of the Soviet Government will he\nincreased If west European Slater, by\ntaking up commercial relations with the\nSoviet Government, give to the latter\nthe chance to Improve the transport pos\n?. bllltles on the Russian railways and\nto supply the Red Army with food and\nclothing.\nThe gravity of the European situation\nstill lncrea??d by the fact that even\n?it ii universal recognition of the danger\nGixrmanv wou'd hardly he able to form\n<n the right time an army that would\nhe adequate In the lesst decree. The\norganization of the German recruiting\nhas been dissolved after the peace treaty\nof Versailles. Consequently there are\nno lists of the men who are to be taken\ninto consideration. It is uncertain\nwhether an appeal for volunteers would\nhave any satisfactory result. But even\nif one were to succeed in getting a num\nber of men together Germany would\nhave no arms to equip such a force. All\nappliances of trie German industry to\nproduce weapons have been done away\nwith. The officers of the old German\narmy are discharged and have taken up\nother professions. The staffs are dis\nsolved.\nWhilst in peace times under very fa\nvorable general conditions the prepara\ntions for the mobilization of an existing\nand well organized army took months\nof time it would be necessary now to\nform an army first and mobilize It at\nthe same time. Even If the Entente In\nthe face of imminent danger were to\nfurnish arms, ammunition, requisites of\nwar and victuals for a new German\narmy, even then months at least would\nbe needed to get It ready. It must\ntherefore, be taken Into corvsiredaUon\nthat the formation of a new German\narmy to fight against Bolshevism cannot\nbe begun and realized In time. Apart\nfrom this it is aggravating that public\nopinion in Germany has not yet been\nenlightened enough about the unavoid\nable necessity of a struggle with the\nBolshevism.\nThe defensive war against Bolshevism\nis difficult and its success /or any length\nof time uncertain. The Bolshevikl do\nnot first attack bodies of troops who\nstand opposite them In the defensive. Jn\nthe forces that stand opposite the BoV\naheviki feelings og being uselessly ex\nposed to the hardships of a campaign}\narise and, what is more, their morals\nwill suffer by continual Inactivity. But\nif the strategic defensive against Bol\nshevist troops is partly led in a tatically\noffensive way by single attacks, the sol\ndier? of the Red Army generally retreat\nbefore such attacks into positions fur\nther back without offering much resist\nance ; such single attacks come to a stop j\nquite automatically. The force which\nfights against the Bolshevlkl cannot see\nany use in this activity. They get ill\nhumored and susceptible of Bolshevist\npropaganda.\nWhile troops who stand opposite the\nBolshevik! in the defensive often lo.se a\ngro it deal of their Inner value, the jBol- |\nshevlki on tho contrary under the proes\nure of an Iron discipline are able to per\nsevere for a very long time. The splendbd\nsystem of espionage of the Soviet Gov\nernment within the Red Army has up\nnow always prevented an effective comp\nter propaganda among the troops of the.\nRed Army. But if once the morals of\nthe troops in the defensive are shaken,\nthen the Bolshevlki on their side pro\ni ceed to the military offensive which in\nmost cases lias brought about the final\nsuccess of the Soviet Government. An\narmy who knows only little about the\nactual character of Bolshevism is nat\nurally more exposed to the Bolshevist\npropaganda than one who knows the ef\nfect of Bolshevism for a longer space of\ntime. Anyway, experience has shown\nthat troops that faced Bolshevism for a\nlonger time were often decomposed un\nder the impression of Bolshevist delu\nsions and have rapidly broken down un\nder military offensives of the Red\narmies.\nForce the Only Alternative.\nA defensive war against Bolshevism\ncannot force the Soviet Government to\nresign and consequently also not form a\nbasis for the reinstatement of the Rus\nsian economic sphere Into the European\neconomic sphere. The only way to at\ntain this is to force the Soviet Govern\nment to resign by means of a military\nIntervention from outside, because the\nRussian people cannot rid themselves of\nthem. But such an Intervention will\nbe successful only If It reaches the real\ncentre of power, which is Moscow.\nAll the offensive up to now of th<\nanti-revolutionary Russian generals who\nwere aiming at Moscow has failed. The\nmost vital reason for it is that they\nwere started with inadequate forces.\nOwing to the extensive vastness of the\nRussian country, military operations In i\nRussia can he successful only If the\nlines of communication of the flehtlng\narmies are properly constructed, If they ?\nwork perfectly and If they can be safe- I\nguarded against attacks. For all this j\nconsiderable contingents of troops nroi\nneeded. The more the armies advance j\nthat operate In Russia the more the j\ntroops that fight in the front line are <\nweakened through the despatching of j\nsoldiers to the lines of communication, j\nwhile on the other hand retreating Bol\nshevist troops shorten their lines of com\nmunication and in this way are able to\nstrengthen their front lines.\nIt Is therefore necessary that armies\nthat are to fight against the Red armies\nof the Soviet Government are so strong\nfrom the start already that they will\nhe sble to remain sufficiently strong In\nthe front line. In spite of repeated des\n! patching of men to the lines of com\nmunication. Then only an advance of\ni their attack without delay is conceivable.\nThis Is of the greatest importance to aji\noffensive against Bolshevist forces, be\ncause at every standstill of the offensive\nthe danger arises that the Bolshevist\npropaganda affects the attacking troops.\nMoreover, It is impossible that an army\nin the offensive against Moscow Issue\nfrom a narrow base of operations. Such\nan army would he exposed to the danger\nof having both flanks threatened and to\nbeing cut off from their lines of com\nmunications.\nMiat Be on Ltrg* Scale.\nEvery military operation with Moscow\nas destination must be carried out on a\nlarge scale. In an adequate proportion\nto the large base of operations which Is\nto be conquered. Also for that reason\nsuch an operation must not be carried\nout without considerable forces. A con\ntingent of 1,500,000 soldiers is the mini\nmum that is needed for an effective of\nfensive war against Bolshevism. It must\nhe further considered that the armies\n?S sufferer* ont of every 100 have\norganic Heart Trouble, at anatomical\nexaminationt have shown, and ?? ??\npermanently restored, after the \"^Mrue\ntlons, generally from distended\niHiirfd abdominal or*nn?. whlcn pray#\nUigalnsf and displace the heart, disturbing\nIt* action, have been removed.

Others read the sport page. Others read the want ads. But the advertis\ning experts claim that everybody reads the advertisements. If you did not road the leading editorial in the blaming Jour\nnal of Saturday, \"May 14, you missed reading one of the most logical presentations of the issues involved in the recall\nelection that has been offered to the voters in the present campaign. For the benefit of the people who desire to be in\nformed; who are seeking facts and not fiction; who are honest in their wishes to vote according to the right and not ac\ncording to the dictates of labor agitators, the editorial referred to is herewith reproduced. Head it. Study it. Then\nform your own conclusions.\nrwiu ' or\noviet vs.\nBeniocracy\nIn saying that the labor leaders are trying to estab\nlish the rule of the soviet instead of the rule of the\npeople in Albuquerque, we are not charging them with\nbeing Bolsheviki in the sense in which we have come to\nuse that word in America. Most of these leaders are not\nsocialists or radicals. Perhaps none of them are con\nsciously so. But just now, in their anxiety to win for the\ndischarged firemen and themselves, they do not exam\nine the politcal philosophy underlying their political un\ndertaking. America believes in the liberty and freedom of the\nindividual. .We have a representative democracy, called\na republic, in which these individuals decide what they\nthink will be best for them by majorities, voting at the\npolls in duly legalized elections. The rights of minorities\nare protected by constitutional limitations upon those\nmajorities.\nThe soviet system believes in the rule of a class. They\ncall it the rule of the proletariat. Under this theory of\ngovernment no one has any right to a voice in the gov\nernment except the workers. All others are excluded.\nThe unions elect representatives and these are the gov\nerning power. This is the soviet. It may be a radical so\nviet, controlled by radical theories, or a more conserva\ntive soviet. It is the method pursued in selecting the rep\nresentatives which is soviet. Bolshevism is quite another\nmatter. Its followers do not believe in private property\nand hold other radical theories. The two generally go\nhand in hand, but not necessarily so.\nWhat the labor leaders are attempting to do in Albu\nquerque is to dictate the policy of the city hall from the\ncentral labor council. When the commission refused to\nbe controlled by them they sought its recall. Two mem\nbers of the commission, who carry union cards, were not\nrecalled. Under the law these two members will select\nthe three new members, if the present members are re\ncalled. Thus the central labor body will take over the\ncity, if the recall is successful.\nWhen the recall was first considered, this fact was\npointed out to the labor leaders and it was suggested to\nthem that all five members be recalled sd that an election\nwould become necessary to select a new commission, in\nthe event of the success of the recall. This they spurned.\nThey saw a chance to take over the city government\nbody and bones. ,\nAs time has elapsed and these leaders have seen that\nthe large conservative element in union labor is not fa\nvorable to the substitution of the soviet for the democ\nracy and are unwilling to hazard the control of the\npolitical machinery of the city by the labor leaders, these\nleaders have sought to change the situation created by\ntheir bold effort to sieze the city government.\nMr. Ed Swope, labor member of the city commission,\nhas suggested to Mr. Ball of the \"People's\" committee\nand to Mr. McRae of the \"Citizens' \" committee, that in\nthe event of a successful recall, these gentlemen each\nnames a new member of the commission and that the\ntwo then select a third. He suggests that Mr. Hughes\n(who carries a card) with himself could then legally\nelect these three as commissioners.\n! This is not as disengenious as it looks. Mr. Hughes\nand Mr. Swope, the hold over, are union men. Mr. Ball\n(a labor leader) selects a third member. There are then\nthree union men out of five, with a fourth man agreeable\nto them.\n; But that is not the basic objection. Mr. McRae quite\ncorrectly points out the fact that neither himself nor Mr.\nBall are chosen representatives of the democracy of peo\nple in Albuquerque. From whence comes their power to\nchoose who shall govern the people of the city? Mr.\nSwope, like Mr. Ball, thinks in terms of the soviet. It\ndoes not occur to them that neither the unions nor the\nbusiness men have any commission from the people to\nselect their city commissioners.\nThe law says that Mr. Hughes and Mr. Swope shall\nselect the successors of their colleagues, in the event of\nthe recall. Mr. McRae is quite right in insisting that no\none else can legally or properly do this.\nThe labor leaders deliberately created this condition.\nThat they have now lost their nerve is no reason for al\nlowing them to run out from under their bold attempt to\ntake over the city. y ' ,\nIf the people are ready to adopt the soviet system\nthey\" should recall the commission and allow Mr. Swope\nand Mr. Hughes to make it such.\nflow that you have read the editorial, can there be any doubt in your mind about how to vote next Friday? If you be\nlieve in sustaining the commission, stand up and assert yourself as a red-blooded American citizen, desiring to maintain\nhonest, efficient government in Albuquerque.\nVote against the recall. Vote against the charter amendment. ;\nrnzEN\nCOMM\n(Advertisement)\nITTEE\nLOUIS McRAE, Chairman.\n1\n11"}, "12": {"url": "https://chroniclingamerica.loc.gov/lccn/sn88078683/1920-12-18/ed-1/seq-13.json", "date": "19201218", "ocr_eng": "SATURDAY, DEC. 18, 1920.\nTHE TOILBB\nPAGE II\nmovement of a number of men influenced by the\nAnarchist doctrines of European Syndicalism,\nwho wished to foist upon us such purely ideal,\nabstract things as, \"local autonomy,\" \"decentral\nization.\" We have found that those who draw\ntheir, revolutionary inspiration from the Bakunist\ndoctrines are blind and deaf to the iron facts of\nindustrial development and the history of class\nstruggles.\nThe I. W. W. was founded by men who had\nstudied and understood the great labors of Karl\nMarx. And it is upon the discoveries of that gen\nius that our theory was built up. Not that we\nare Marxian dogmatists, but we insist upon the\nspirit of Marxian teaching: we insist upon the\nfoundation of our ideas upon the rock bottom\nof ECONOMIC FACT, and not upon high-sounding\n\"libertarian\" theory.\nI believe that it was absolutely necessary for\nthe Soviet Government to confine certain \"An\narchist\" and \"Anarcho-Syndicalist\" idealistic\nnoise-makers. I believe it because I know it has\nbeen absolutely necessary in the I. W. W. to re\npress the disrupting activities of similar types.\nThe writer of the article calls for \"democracy''\nin Russia. He joins there with the critics of the\nbourgeois press, who howl about the lack of de\nmocracy in Soviet Russia. It is well to have de\nmocracy if you can afford it. But, in the period\noftransition, when the government of the work\ners of Russia and nc one can dispute that the\nSoviet Government is supported by the majority\nof the Russian workers is engaged in fighting\na desperate capitalist class within, and a ring of\ncapitalistic powers without, can we expect it to\nact without regard to facts, according to the\ndictates of some pink-dreamed abstract concep\ntion of \"democracy\"? Even as it is, there is more\ndemocracy m Russia than in any other country\nin the world. If the Soviet government only rep\nresents seventy per cent of the population, and\nhas thirty per cent opposed to it, it comes nearer\nto being popular government than any that has\nexisted in the world's history. In the rest of the\nworld's countries, the governments represent\nabout ten per cent, and ignore ninety per cent!\nWhether we like it or not, the eyes of the workers\nof the world are directed towards the great ex\nperiment of the Russian Soviet Republic. Whether\nit square with our preconceived theories of how\nrevolutions should be made, or whether it be, or\nnot, the method we believe in for other countries, -Ihe\nRussian Revolution js a Great Fact. And the\nmasses of the world are looking towards it for\nlight and encouragement. Hemmed in by enemies,\nvillified by the reptile press of all lands, lied about,\nmisrepresented and abused; fought with the\narms, ammunition and money of the great capital\nistic powers; a prey to starvation and want;\nSoviet Russia still stands heroically working at\nher mighty task of creating a Workers Republic,\nan Industrial Commonwealth. For, it must be re\nmembered, the Bolsheviks have never said that\nthe present government of Russia is the ideal\none, the final one. In everything Lenin and his\niriends have written, they have stated that the\nDictatorship of the Proletariat is but a temporary\naffair which shall continue until the transference\nof the means of production and distribution, from\nthe control of the capitalist to that of the work\ners, shall have been completed.\nShall we then join in this chorus of abuse;\nshall we swl the yelping of the bourgeois press?\nPersonally, f can only say that I think the atti\ntude of our organization towards the struggling\nrevolution of Russia should be that of whole\nhearted encouragement and fraternity. And I, for\none, shall not let the appeal of the \"Comrade\nEmigrant Doctor\" and his fair wife, from an un\nknown place, change my present viewpoint. I shall\nneed far more proof than the appeals of a few of\nour Anarchists friends, before I believe that, as\nthis article remarks, \"we fail to see the difference\nbetween the Lenin-Trotzky regime in Russia and\nthe Wilson-Palmer-Burleson regime in America.\"\nIn fact, I think nothing would more delight the\nenemies of the workers' movement anywhere than\nto read such a remark in our organ. And that is\nwhy I have written this article.\nI do not want to suffer the shame of having\nour official organ quoted by capitalist opponents\nof Soviet Russia in support of their attacks. I do\nnot want to see our magazine quoted to the mili\ntant workers of this country, when they refuse to\nsupport the bandit-war against Russia, by refrain\ning from shipping munitions to the agents of the\nWhite Terror.\nI do not want the I. W. W. to be identified in\nany way with, nor to give any aid to, the dirt7\ntrickery of the agents of international capitalism.\nAnd I refuse to criticize the actions of the Soviet\nGovernment in their counter-revolutionary steps"}, "13": {"url": "https://chroniclingamerica.loc.gov/lccn/sn78004468/1920-08-13/ed-1/seq-14.json", "date": "19200813", "ocr_eng": "Vhf\nIf I-\n\u2022f*\n5,\nPage Fourteen\n1024 Nicollet Ave.\nN.

C. B.)\u2014On\nTuesday last Judge Harry Fish\ner of Chicago and Max Pine,\nthe Jewish labor leader of this\ncity, returned to this country\nafter an absence of six months.\nFisher and Pine went to Europe\nin behalf of the Joint Distribu\ntion Committee. It was original\nly intended that they should go\nio the Ukraine but finding them\nselves unable to penetrate those\nregions, they remained in Poland\nuntil they obtained permission to\nenter Soviet Russia. In Russia\nthe relief representatives spent a\nconsiderable number of weeks\nand at their departure felt satis\nfied with their efforts to organize\nJewish relief in Soviet territory.\nMost of their time was spent in\nMoscow and it was they who\nwere instrumental in releasing the\none hundred and odd leading\nZionists who had just then been\nplaced under arrest by the gov\nernment.\nv The arrest ol the ^Zionists in\nMoscow was chiefly the result of\nthe bitter opposition which Jew\nish Communists in Soviet Russia\nbear towards the Zionists.

Lozovzky.\nThe first all- Russian Congress of Trade Unions,\nlaying down the general line of revolutionary\npolicy and the necessity for the closest co-operation\nand inseparable connection with the Soviets\nof Workers Deputies, came up against one of the\nmost difficult questions in the theory and prac\ntice of the Trade Union movement, i. e., the role\nof Trade Unions in the period of proletarian dic\ntatorship. What is the dictatorship of the pro\nletariat? It is a definite labor system of gov\nernment, having for its object to destroy the\nbourgeois Capitalist relations and the state\nmachinery created by them, to crush the resist\nance of the exploiters and to prepare the condi\ntions and foundations for Socialist construction.\nBetween Capitalism and Socialism there is a dis\ntinct historical period during which the oppressed\nclass, taking advantage of the new government\nmachinery which it has created, forcibly estab\nlishes new social industrial relations, and, to the\nextent that these new relations are strengthened,\nthe State power of the transition period gradually\ndies out; for Socialist society is a non-class\nsociety, and where there no classes there is no\nState. Consequently, to the extent that we de\npart from Capitalism and approach to Socialism\nthe state as such will disappear, and, as Engels\nwrote, it will be placed in the museum of history.\nThe state will remain a mere apparatus for the\nregistration of distribution and production, seiv\ning the economic needs of Socialist society.\nThe Soviet is an organ of proletarian dictator\nship, and as a definite form of state will dis\nappear with the complete victory of Socialism.\nBut what will be the fate of the Trade Unions?\nThe Trade Unions have become converted from\nfighting organizations against Capital into organs\nof Socialist construction, and to the extent that\nwe advance from Capitalism to Communism the\ncentre of gravity of the work of the union will be\ntransferred to the sphere of organization and\nadministration. The main task of organizing\nlabor and production lies upon the Trade Unions,\nand the more the Trade Unions are able to cope\nwith this task the more it will become merged\nin national economy and become part and parcel\nof it. In a completely developed Socialist society\nthe Trade Unions as fighting organizations in the\nclass war will disappear, and their place will be\ntaken by an apparatus for registration, distribu\ntion, and public production.\nBut where will this apparatus for registering,\ndistributing, and producing in Socialist society\nNcome from? What organization will create it?\nEvidently it will be created in the transitional\nperiod by the Trade Unions and the Soviets.\nAnd its importance will grow in proportion to\nthe victry of the social revolution and the\nstrengthening of the new industrial relations.\nThus, the Soviets of workers' deputies and the\nTrade Unioins jointly create in the transitional\nperiod an organ for managing production (Coun\ncils of National Economy and the chief com\nmittees for the management of nationalized\nundertakings). These organs, however, lose their\nspecific character as fast as we advance to Social\nism ; the whole work of the Soviets and the Trade\nUnions becomes concentrated upon the organiza\ntion of labor and production, but their idustrial\nfunctions disappear. The Trade Unions and the\nSoviet economic organs merge into one another;\na single economic machinery grows out of it,\nswallowing both unions and Soviets, thus being\nthe synthesis of all the organisations created by\nthe proletariat. Socielism emerges in its perfect\nthe proletariat. Socialism emerges in its perfect\nform of organisation. This perspective of the de\nvelopment and the rebirth of the existing prole\ntarian organizations gives rise to the idea of\n\"nationalizing\" the Trade Unions, and many com\nrades regarded this possibility as meaning the\nimmediate subordination of the Trade Unions to\nthe Soviet Government. The first all-Russian con\ngress of Trade Unions which advocated the\nclosest co-operation and unseverable connection\nbetween the Trade Uions and the Soviet of\nworkers' deputies declared in its fundamental re\nsolution that \"in the process of development\nwhich has been outlined the Trade Unions will\ninevitably be converted into organs of Socialist\nGovernment, participation in which will be obli\ngatoiy for all persons engaged in any given in-"}, "15": {"url": "https://chroniclingamerica.loc.gov/lccn/sn88078683/1920-09-24/ed-1/seq-4.json", "date": "19200924", "ocr_eng": "PAGE 4\nTHE TOILER\nFRIDAY, SEPT. 24, 1920\nThe British Council of Action\nBy Felix Morley\nEuropean Correspondent for the Federated Press,\ni\nFormation of the Council of Action by\nBritish labor is conceded by friends and foes\nalike to be the most important single occurence\nin England since the declaration of war in 1914.\nIt has achieved its primary aim 1;hat of pro\nventing further agression by the British gov\nernment against Soviet Russia. Now it stands\nready to assert its power in other directions.\nThe war scare has gone. Manifestly, the wish\nof labor to keep out of the threatened new im\nperialistic war was the wish of 'the 'great mass\nof England's people. \"When the Council of Ac\ntion was formed, the atmosphere in London (so\nfriends tell me) was like that attending the de\nclaration of war against Germany except that\nall the feverish utterances in the streets were\nanti- and not pro-war.\nOpen declaration that six million British\nwage earners would cease production rather\nthan see another war has had tremendous in\nfluence on the Continent. It has insured maint\nenance of strict neutrality in Germany; it is\nhastening formal recognition of Soviet Russia\nby Italy; it is even driving breaches in the\nstrongholds of French reaction which are so\nlargely responsble for the contnued chaos of\nEurope.\n\"Machinery For Revolution.\"\nTho great fact which stands in relief against\nthe turbulent welter of events is that organized\nlabor, and not Parliament, is directing the out\ncome of political issues. Local Councils are\nspringing up spontaneously all over England.\nTheir functions at the present time arc limit\ned to \"collecting information\" and preparing\nto make protest on the Russian issue effective,\nif tho parent council deems drastic ncccssaiy.\nBut it requires no gift of vision to see what\nthese local councils might become. They are\nbeing denounced as \"machinery for revolu\ntion\" and \"British Soviets\" by the conserva\ntive press, although their power is specifically\nlimited to thfone issue of Russia. Another fact\nwhich brings no consolation to opponents of the\nBoviet idea ia that tho local councils of action\nin the larger cities arc being built on a much\nbroader basis than the trades union councils\nwhich they may in time supplant.\nFor instance, in the Council of Action for the\nGreater London area, are represented the Lon\ndon Labor Party, the members of the London\nCounty Council, the co-operative organizations,\nthe Womens' Co-operative Guild and the Lon\ndon Trades Council as a whole, as well afe re\npresentatives from - the principal unions and\nfederations here. Jt is an injustice to the states\nmanlike development of the British Labor\nmovement to suppose that in the recent crisis\nis found the origin of the- councils of action.\nSo fai-as a development of this sort can be said\nto hare a definitive origin it is found in the\nlesson of consolidated strength provided by\nthe Triple Alliance of inkers, railwaymcn and\ntransport workers.\nHave Three 'Present Objects.\nThe National Council, and the local ones, are\nempowered to remain in existence only until\nthey have obtained these things:\n1 Absolute guarantee that the armed forces\nof Great Britain shall not be used in support\nof Poland, Baron Wrangel, nor any other mili\ntary or naval effort against the Soviet govern\nment. 2 Withdrawal of all British naval forces\noperating directly or indirectly as a blockad\ning influence against Russia.\n3 Recognition of the Russian soviet govern\nment and establishment of unrestricted trad\ning and commercial relationships between\nGreat Britain and Russia.\nSo far only the first of these demands has\nbeen conceded by the Lloyd George govern\nment, and the presence of the third insures that\nthe councils will continue to function for some\nlnoriths at least, although a prominent English\nlabor lender tells me that \"we have private\ninformation that Lloyd George intends to re\ncognize the Soviet republic m soon as possible.\"\ni\nil\nn\ni"}, "16": {"url": "https://chroniclingamerica.loc.gov/lccn/sn88078683/1920-11-06/ed-1/seq-2.json", "date": "19201106", "ocr_eng": "PAGE 2\nTHE TOILER\nSATURDAY, NOV. 0, 1920.\nNovember Seventh\nBy H.

Out of the factories came\nthe workers, joining with the sailors from Kron\nstadt and the soldiers from the Garrison of Pet\nrograd t answer the call of the Bolsheviks for\nthe armed revolt against the Kerensky regime.\nInto this' battle they moved in a new spirit, sing\ning hymns of the revolution and under the impact\nof their mighty assaults the decaying structure\nof capitalism tottered and fell to the ground. Ke\nrensky fled. The workers' revolution was victor\nious. .\nBut this was not all; the fall of Kerensky\nmeant but the beginning of the struggle. Capital\nism was overthrown, but there still remained the\ncapitalists, plotting and scheming to get back into\npower. The workers knew that until their resist\nance was completely broken the revolution was\nnot safe. They knew also, as they still know, that\nas long as other capitalist governments stand In\nthe world, the soviet government is in danger. So,\nfor the purpose of suppressing with merciless\nforce the counter-revolution at home and defend\ning themselves against the Allied bandits, they\nestablished the working class dictatorship.\nThe Workers Dictatorship.\nA dictatorship, says Bukharin, is a power\nstrong as iron. Its function is to defend the rule\nof the proletariat against all cornel's. This is the\nway it has operated in Russia. The workers are\nnow in the saddle and they rule with an iron\nhand.

The former\ntyrants are humbled in the dust, while the work\ners rule and dictate A fulfillment of the poet's\nprophecy, \"The master shall drop the whip, and\nthe slave shall enslave the master\"!\nThe war was still on.

Russia began to starve. The blockade with\nout was supplemented by sabotage within. The\nrailroads, demoralized by long years of insanse .\nwar, were still further crippled by the murderous\ncrews of capitalist counter-revolutionists within\nSoviet Russia, who, under the protection and with\nthe aid of Foreign Legations, organized their\ndastardly expeditions to wreck trains, blow up\nbridges and shoot engineers all for the purpose\nof breaking down the Soviet machinery to the\nend that Czarism might be reestablished..\nThen came the invading armies of Allied Cap\nitalism. England, France, America all the noble\nchampions of \"democracy\" joined in the unholy\nconspiracy against the Workers' Government. Did\na single general of the Czar's regime declare\nagainst the Soviets, the war materials of the cap\nitalist world were at his disposal. Did one weak\n'ness show itself along the immense border of\nRussia, there was massed at this point the soldiers\nof the Powers, even to the frozen North. Declara\ntions of war were not made, it is true, but never\nhave belligerents better understood that it was,\nand is, war to the finish.\nIn the face of all this, the Russian masses\nstood undaunted.

Col. Robins told Mr.\nHard of his experiences in Russia, and\njthis very able and individual journalist\nreported what was told in his own way,\nparaphrasing, epitomizing, dramatizing\njftven, as seemed to him effective. He\noes not stay in the background. Not\nbnly docs his writer's \"fist\" appear;\nhis voice is heard. The matter may\nbe Robins. The manner' is unmis\ntakably Hard, and Mr. Hard's sense of\nnarrative values is as strong as his\nfinely simple style is vivid.\nCol. Robins's method of dealing with'\nJhe Bolshevik heads in Russia as re\nported by Mr. Hard seems atfirst\nglance to have been not unlike Editha'a\nmethod of dealing with tile burglar.\nBut Col. Robins was making the best\nof the Russian situation as he found it,\nand as this book depicts it the situa\ntion when his acquaintance with Leuine\nand Trotzky began was so. precarious\nfrom his point of view that the Ameri\ncan Ambassador had said to him, \"If\nour (pro-Kcrensky) propaganda fails\nyou will be shot.\" Naturally, for the\nfake of his\" Red Cross work; not to\nfepeak of his own sake, Col. Robins in\n'circumstances like these was obliged to\n'get on with the leadership in power,\nfend so he did.\nHaving studied it in action he is\nkfraid of Bolshevism the idea. Mr.\nHard says he is tho most anti-Bolshe-,Yik\nperson he has ever known and be\nlieves that the economic system of\nBolshevism is \"morally unsound and\nIndustrially unworkable.\" But he\nIhinks he knows a corpse when ho sees\none, and. once Kercnsky had fallen ho\n'didn't, there on the scene, propose to\ntit up with tho corpse of Kercnsky'a\nGovernment. We aro told that he\nlabored for 'fcerensky as long as there\nra3 a choice between him and Lenine.\nThen, oa tho NovemDer day in 1917\nJffhen the Bolsheviki took the Fortress\nof Peter and Paul in Pctrograd, Col.\nRobins went to see Trotzky, addressed\nhim as \"Mr., Commissioner,\" person\nally recognized him as a head of the\nfaction w'ith which business now had to\nbe transacted and asked him politely to\nJrobstitutc Soviet for the Kerensky\nJpiards'on a Red Cross train.\nIL\n, Having adopted this attitude toward\n, he ascendant 'Bolsheviks Col. Robins\n' Acquired ' an intimato acquaintance\nI such as no other American or Allied\nj representative for a long timo even\n' fried to get\" with Lcnine's Govern\nment. He saw Lenine on an average\nthrco times a week. Ho had a special\npass tha t admitted him straight to Le\nnine !s room in \"the Smolny. The only\ntimfcit lo:6kcd as if the pass might not\n' honored, as fioL Robins found bayo-'\nCol. Raymond Robins.\nnets barring the way, was when the\nBolsheviks had learned of the project\nto send Red Cross motor cars and\nmoney through Soviet into anti-Soviet\nterritory. \"Trotzky,\" says Col. Rob\ninsor Mr. nard \"was profoundly\nshocked. He could not witness such\nviolations of ctiquetto without grief\nand horror.\"\nAnd Col. Robins himself had refused\nto lend his sanction to the project,\nholding it \"unethical.\" It implies no\nsort of compromise on his part with\nBolshevik principles when he says that\nin his relations with the Lenine Gov\nernment \"I tried to deal with them on\ntho square and they came back on the\nsquare every time.\" When he asked\nthe Government to let 400,000 cans of\nmilk come through from Murmansk\nto Pctrograd tho milk, with the Sovietf\nfrank, arrived on scheduled time.\nLenine 's success Col. Robins attrib-'\nutes chiefly to Lcnine's shrewd recog\nnition of tho fact of the Soviet and of\nits hold on tho popular mind and to'\nhis joining it up with tho revolution\nunder the popular slogan \"All power\nto the Soviet.\" According to Mr.\nHard Col. Robins himself was equally\ndiscerning and \"found\" the Soviet ai\na key to the new 'situation while the\nrest of the diplomats were only hearing\nabout it. In Hard's expressive phrase\nRobins \"knocked his shins\" Against\nthe Soviet at the town of Chita in Si\nberia when arriving in Russia with tho\nRed Cross mission in August, 1917;\ntheir train was examined by a local\ngovernment operating independently.\nAfter that, Col. Robins discovered,\nwhen ho wanted a train or wagons or\nanything he had to ask the Soviet for\nit At Petrograd it was the Smolny,\nnot the Winter Palace, that counted.\nIIIV\nAmong the Allied and American\ndiplomats, agents, &c, in Russia at that\ntime Mr. Hard represents Col. Robins\nas having been in a magnificent mi\nnority in understanding Bolshevism.\nCol. Robins docs not understand Rus\nsian. He worked through interpreters,\nreading all the papers and going to\nSmolny every day. Tho difference be\ntween the gauge of his vision acid, peri\nccption in observing and estimating\nthe newly established Soviet regime\nand those of all other foreigners in,\nPctrograd who had ,dealipgar with.it\nMr. Hard indicates by calling Robjns's\nthe outdoor\" as opposed, to the -\"in-\"\ndoor\" mind. If Robins had had Ew\nway tho Allied Governments and ours\nwould have cooperated with Lenine and\nTrotzky toward tho common end of\nundermining and wrecking the German\nimperial structure.\nThe book tells of tho nnmerous pro\nposals which the Bolsheviks submitted\nto Robins as unofficial representative\nof tho American Ambassador, waking\nhim the go-between of their overtures\nto Washington. These proposals, which\n. were refused or ignored, ranged from\nallowing American officers to guard\ngoods and munitions from passing into\ntho hands of Germany and going halves\non -a plan to restore Russia's transpor\ntation system to the final appeal of the\nfamous \"suppressed\"' memorandum m\nwhich, with the Germans advancing on\nPetrograd and tho Russians refusing to '\ntight, Lenine asked what definite aid m\n. would promise him should he still with\nhold his Government in extremis from\nsigning the Brest-Litovsk treaty For\nthe answer to this appeal, which never\ncame, Lenino is represented as having\nwaited until the opening of the fourth\nAll Russian Congress; he called Robins\nto tho platform and asked him whathe\nhad heard from America. Robins hav\ning heard nothing, \"Then the treatv\nwill be signed,\" said Lenine, who had\nforeseen that it must bo all along.\nIn the despairing language of Col\nRobins, or Mr. Hard? \"Lenine and\nIrotzky came to think that tho Allies\nwould never cooperate with them for\nany purpose.\" From that time, says\ntho book, the shadow of Lenine grew\neclipsing Trotzky and all the others'\nuntil his power was absolute and un\nquestioned. IV.\nThat Col. Robins sees through the\nfallacy of belief in such a Utopia and of\nthe means being taken in Russia toward\nrealizing it is made perfectly plain\nespecially at the end of the book, where\nMr. Hard lets him speak for himself\nas he did in an address to Somo Ameri\ncan business men. He thinks that\nthe Bolshevik fallacy is the real and a\nterrible danger, apart from such feat\nures of a Bolshevik revolution as the\nterror, which by comparison was iuci\ndental. But he thinks that in order to\ncombat Bolshevism it is necessary to\nunderstand it, to meet idea with idea.\nThe Soviet system could succeed and\nspread only in the event of American \"\n.industry refusing to profit by the ex\nperience of Russia and to apply itself\nseriously to the task of \"combining\nfree leadership with service\" Not\nmany right minded people will quarrel\nwjth that. Having stated it Col. Robins\nand Mr. Hard would do well tq follow\nit up, expanding and explaining the\nthesis, in a sequel to this honest and\nwell and timely written book.\nBAYATOND\" ROBINS' OWN 8T0BY.

Our\nactivity, which may turn our earth into an in\ndustrial hive of buzzing machines engaged in use\nful production, is now diverted to its mutilation and\ndestruction. Our science is corrupted, and becomes\ndestructive: armoured trains, torpedo boats, am\nmunition factories, military aeroplans, dynamite\non which gluttonous Imperialism feeds half the\nguilt for all this falls on us, engineers. Some of us\nhave sold our professional conscience for comforts\nof life, others, out of fear, obediently canned out\nthe murderous orders.

The\nvictorious proletariat leads us into a sphere of use\nful social production, into wide regions of peaceful\nconquests of the human mind.\nCapitalist oppression has made technical science\nnot only unmoral, but has brought it to stagnation\nand degeneration. Shutting out the wide field of\ninvention, it drives our powerful work into the\nsmall channels of refining and perfecting the\ntrifles of Capitalism. The efforts of the engineers\nare not directed to the erection of great, hygienic\nproletarian centres, but to serving the appetites of\nHigh Society for luxury and this is the sign of\ndecline.\nThe Russian engineers were at one time the\nenemies of the proletarian revolution. They were\nin error. Events have proved to them the right\nouaness of the cause of the revolutionary workers\nNow the Russian engineers have become convinced\nof the fruitfulness of the economic measures of the\nSoviet Government, and are now glad to contribute\ntheir share of work o the social endeavours.\nEngineers' sections have been formed in the\nlarge industrial unions of Russia Thoy do not\npursue narrow professional interests; these are\nsufficiently well looked after by the Soviet Gov\nernment. Their main aim is to unite closely the\nindustrial body of manual and intellectual labour\nby distributing the highly skilled human labour in\nthe given industry and carrying out scientific and\npractical measures on a large scale.

After the Revolution : Land belonging to Soviet\nCommunes, Industrial Institutions etc. 2.7 per\ncent, land Collectively farmed 0.8 per cent, and in\nthe hands of the peasants, 96 per cent. .\nThe land of the landlords went chiefly to the\npeasants. Indeed, 85.9 per cent went to the\npeasants, 11.9 was taken by the State, and 2.2 per\ncent was occupied under collective farms. Thus,\nthe first outcome of the policy of the Soviet Go\nvernment was the transference of most of the\nland to the wide masses of the toiling peasantry.\nStill, however large the area of land that had\npassed to the peasants, it had introduced no ma\nterial change in the size of the plot of the in\ndividual holder. In the majority of provinces the\nnew land transferred is represented per head in\ndecimals, and even less, of a deciatine of land.\nThus wide masses of peasants have grasped the\nfact that the bits of land added to their holdings\nwere not sufficient. It was necessary to raise the\nquestion of increasing productivity. With this\nobject in view and with the object of organizing\nagriculture on communist lines, the Soviet Gov\nernment paid particular attention to collective\nforms of cultivation and to Soviet Communes. The\norganization of such forms of agriculture gave\nthe opportunity to the poor peasants lacking\ninventory and means, to secure a livelihood for\nthemselves and their families by passing to more\nadvantageous and more efficient methods of\ncultivation. t\nThe returns from the communes give the fol\nlowing picture.\nOn the 1st Nov. 1918 there were 950 com. (in 26 prov.)\nOn the 1st Nov. 1919 there were 1986 com. (in 31 prov.)\nIn September 1920 there were 1826 (com.

On the ground\nof certain data, the Agriculture on Communist\nlines Department assumes the number of collect\nive establishments' in the country to be not less\nthan 15.000.\nThe Soviet Communes represent the newest\nform of agricultural activity. They were not in\nexistence during the first year of the revolution\nand appeared first in February 1919. They are\nbeing organised for the purpose of increasing pro\nduction by intensive agriculture and by increasing\nthe cultivated area, thus preparing the ground for\na compelte transition to Communist agriculture\nand to the creation of exemplary agronomic\ncentres.\nAll Soviet Comunes of state importance are\nin charge of the Commissariat for Agriculture.\nApart from this a number of Soviet Communes\nare in charge of Industrial Unions and serve the\nneeds of the organizations that have formed them.\nThe recent returns of the Soviet Communes date\nfrom the end of July 1920. According to these\nthere are 3076 Soviet Communes in 40 provinces\nof Russia exclusive of sugar plantations and\nCommunes in charge of the Industrial Unions\n(neither do these figures include the Ukrainia,\nthe Don, Siberia and North Caucasus).\nThe number of communes in charge of in\ndustrial organization is 1,020 in 27 provinces.\nThe total area of Soviet Communes covers 1 .638,\n567 deciatines. The total area of the Communes\nformed by industrial organizations is 600,000\ndeciatines.\nAll the land, no matter in whose hands it is,\nbelongs to the State. The tenure, however, is very\nkaleidoscopic representing a mixture of personal\nand collective holding. It entails a tremendous\nwork of surveying and redistributing the land.\nOur problem is to create one producing agricultur\nal economy yielding the maximum of agricultural\nproduce with the minimum of national labor, a\ntask which involves the gradual redistribution of\nthe land.\nThe chief hindrance in the way of building up\nagriculture on Communist lines is the -lack of\nsurveyors and agricultural experts. With 35,000\nsurveyors the agricultural problem could be ac\ncomplished in one year, but with the present\nnumber of 4.000 the work is naturally delayed.\nThe Tragic Death of Three French Militants.\nLast summer the left syndicalist unions of\nFrance chose three delegates to go to Russia to\nrepresent them at the Third International as well\nas to try to organize the Revolutionary Trade\nUnion International.\nThe delegates were comrades Marcel Vergeat,\none of the secretaries of the Metal Workers Union ;\nLepetit, a well known militant of the Building\nWorkers Union; and the exiled secretary of the\nRailroad Wor) ers Federation, Leon Midol. For\nsome reason oi other, comrade Midol did not go.\nWhen the two delegates arrived in Russia, they\nwrote back enthusiastic articles and letters about\nthe achievements of the Russian Workers. Some\nof Vergeat's impressions were printed in \"LA VIE\nOUVRIERE\", organ of the left syndicalists.\nAfter making a tour in southern Russia, U\nkraine and Odessa, our comrades returned to Mos\ncow, preparing themselves to leave for France in\norder to take part in the Orleans congress of the\nC. G. T. during the last days of September. As the\ninternational police was on the look-out for them,\nthey could not return thru Finland, Esthonia or\nPoland. They had to choose the risky and uncertain\nnorthern route, thru the icy Artie Ocean.\nThey left Murmansk on a small sailing boat\nwith one sailor and our comrades in- France were\nexpecting them to arrive in time to counter-act\nMerrheim's insidious propaganda against the Rus\nsian Communists. But there was no news from\nthem for over a month and then anxiety and fear\nfor their fate filled the hearts of their fellow\nworkers. During the last days of November the\nmetal workers and the COMITE DES SYNDICAL\nIST REVOLUTIONARIES made in inquiry thru\n\"L'HUMANITE\" from the Swedish Soviet envoy.\nThe news that Tie wired was distressing Lepetit,\nVergeat and Raymond Lefebvre, delegate of the\nFrench Communists, have perished somewhere in\nthe sea. .\nThe Committee of Revolutionary Syndicalists,\na body representing all the left unions in France,\nimmediately organized relief for the families of\nour martyred comrades and within few days the\nworkers of Paris, themselves in the midst of un\nemployment and want, collected the sum of 10,000\nfrancs.\nG.

The year following the\nOctober Revolution, was marked by the salwtage\nof the Russian intellectuals. Societies such as\nthose of doctors, teachers, consulting engineers,\netc., took part in this sabotage in every way, hind\nering the work of the Soviet Government. Now,\nhowever, after the lapse of three years, we see\nthese people marching side by side with the work\ners. The subjoined appeal issued by the Engineer's\nsection of the Industrial Union of Transport Work\ners in an example of the radical change which has\nset in, in the minds of the Russian intelligentzia.\nIt is to be voted that this manifesto is signed by\nProfessor Greduskui, formerly leading member of\nthe Executive Committee of the Cadet Party and\nVice-President of the Second Imperial Duma.\nThe bourgeois and social-patriotic Press who\nhave sold their literary honour for francs and\npounds, is full of insinuations alout Soviet Russia.\nTo please their masters, they represent the Soviet\nRepublic as a country where chaos and sanguinary\narbitrariness reign supreme, where peaceful citi\nzens are killed without trial', whore the centres of\nculture and education are destroyed, the intellec\ntuals persecuted, and the economic resources of\nRussia senselesly wasted. All this, however, is most\nconclusively refuted by the great self-sacrifice and\nlove with which the masses of the Russian people\nmaintain their Socialist rights ; by the great educa\ntional work carried trough by the emancipated\nworkers, the stamping out of illiteracy in the back\nward country, the dozens of new universities and\ninstitutes being opened, and by the light of know\nledge and education which the Soviet movement is\nintroducing even in the remotest Kalmick villages.\nThe sympathies of all the better elements of\nhumanity for Soviet Russia continue to grow. H.\nG. Wells, Anatole France, Forei, Henry Barbusse,\nthe late Jack London, and Professor Timiriaseff,\nthe most talented people of our time, are our\nfriends or our adherents. Gradually, not only the\nrepresentatives of art and letters, but also of science\nare coming to our side; it is because the vitality of\nCommunism is so great and the economic work\ncarried through by the Soviet Government is so im\nposing. The State distribution of commodities\nwhich turns the State into an enormous lalwur co\noperative society saves us from starvation under\nthe most unfavourable conditions. The systematic\ntrustification of Russian industry, which abolishes\nchaos and competition in production, inspires us\nwith the unshakable conviction that the end of the\nsevere struggle will signify the beginning of the\ngrandest unfolding and development of the Russian\nState industries. It goes without saying that we\ncould not attain the successes standing to our cre\ndit if it were true that Soviet Russia is \"shooting\ndown professors and, hanging engineers.\" On the\ncontrary, we owe our successes to the fact that\npeople with knowledge, who are prepared to work\nhonestly, are placed in such material conditions as\nwill secure them a peaceful activity free of domes\ntic cares and will allow them full scope for scien-\nmm"}, "23": {"url": "https://chroniclingamerica.loc.gov/lccn/sn84037526/1920-08-26/ed-1/seq-3.json", "date": "19200826", "ocr_eng": "ket is in o deplorabie condition\u2019\u2019.\n_ London, Aug. 21st. >The nzed of a\nRusso-German agreement to save Ku\nrope from an economic catastrophe and\nfrom chaos, is emphasized in a wireless\nmessage from Moscow. published in the\nLondon Times vesterday.

This review of the activities\nof the Commission in dealing with the varied\nactivities of countcr-revobitionr.iy elements iu\nRussia during the three years ot Soviet Rule\nexplains fully the causes which provoked the\nestablishment of this powerful force for the\ndefense of the Revolution and points out the\ntactics which proletarian evolutions in other\ncountries will probably have to adopt in the\nstruggle with the opposing i'oiics Of reaction.\n\"CONDITIONS WHICH CALLED INTO EX\nISTENCE THE ALL-RUSSIAN EXTRA\nORDINARY COMMISSION\"\n\"Every state is an apparatus of violence.\n\"This has always been so, is so, and will\nbe so while the state as such continues in\ngeneral to exist.\n\"This will end not earlier than classes dis\nappear together with the class struggle.\n\"In a society based on classes one class al\nways contests power with the other ; the sup\npressed class attempts to escape from its\ncondition of dependence and to take the place\nof the class wielding power.\n\"Therefore a class possessing power must\nhave an apparatus specially adapted for con\nflict with all forms of discontent, which blaze\nup sometimes in the vivid flames of revolt and\nrevolution.\n\"The monarchist government overthrown\nby the February revolution (1917) serves as\na clear example of this adaptation for the\"\nconflict with other (revolutionary) classes.\n\"During its many years of existence, it\nbrought this apparatus for conflict with re\nbellion to a state of perfection.\n\"A giant who has not yet learned his\nstrength is not dangerous to anyone.\n\"No one applied this truth better than the\nformer state. All of its energy was directed\nto the end of rearing the people in ignorance.\n\"For this end there were at the service of\nthe old government the school, the church,\nand the barracks.\n\"The programme of the schools and the\ntext books were all directed to the one purpose\nof raising obedient and convinced slaves of the\nruling class.\n\"The church continued the work of the\nschools and up to the door of the tomb held\nfirmly within itstenets the spirit of the\nmany-millioned masses of the people, pressing\nforward toward the light.\n\"What part of the free spirit remained a\nlive after the school and the church, the\nbarracks killed.\n\"Whoever passed through this dual school\nbecame a spiritual invalid, a pawn, a submis\nsive tool in the hands of the possessors of\npower.\n\"The strong Russian giant, who had within\n1 im enough latent force to shake the whole\nsphere of earth, could not throw off from his\nback the Ixmrgeois class, which, like a vam\npire, sucked the vital energy of the people for\nits gratification.\n\"The giant had not yet learned his strength.\n\"But when, despite this clever mechanism,\nfreedom of thought began to appear among\nthe people, they began to beat it out with the\nlash and to uproot 'treason' by the prison,\nexile, hard labor, and expropriation, and there\nwas established the apparatus of internal\nespionage (Okhrana), the secret section, and\nthe special corps of the gendarmes, not to\ni i ration the police.\n\"Such an apparatus was necessary to the\nruling class, for only on this basis could it\ncontinue its rule.\nAUTOCRACY TYRANNIZED WISELY,\n\"There was nothing abnormal alnnit this;\nit was all in the natural course of things and\ncould not be otherwise. To defend existence\nis a natural and comprehensible phenomenon.\nIt would have been stupidity from ti ir side\nrot to do it. They had enough sense to stand\nup for themselves.\n\"They established their dielatorsh'p.\n\"But this class had no firm ground under\nItl feet. It was a condemned class, and the\nFebruary revolution tore the power from fts\nhands.\n\"Its successors found themselves in no bet\nt r situation. They were threatened ly the\nworkers from beneath and by the Czarist of\nficials from above.\n\"The February revolution did not destroy\nclasses and the class struggle, but spread the\nfire still more broadly.\n\"The state remained a class state and\nneeded an apparatus of compulsion. .\n\"We see how Kerensky established his\ncounter espionage and put people in prison\nand executed his Bolshevist opponents.\n\"He established a militia, legalized the\ndeath penalty, and blessed the massacre.\n\"All this was in the order of things: the\nnew power must defend its existence and beat\nits adversaries.\n\"The October revolution made the class\nstruggle still sharper. The proletariat hurled\nits challenge to the entire old world. Th?\nstruggle became a fight not for life, but to\nthe death. For the class which stood in power,\nthe proletariat, it was necessary t- endure\nattacks by the bourgeoisie of a character\nnever before known. The bourgeoisie fought\nnot only on the open external front, but also\nin the rear. Opposing both secretly and open\nly, betraying our secrets, and preparing plots,\nit destroyed our security in the rear, lessened\nour fighting ability and thus prepared victory\nfor the White Guards on the external fronts.\n\"The October revolution did not destroy\nclasses; the bourgeoisie was driven from\npower but not destroyed.\n\"For the victorious proletariat it was ne\ncessary to preserve the state, that apparatus\nof violence, an apparatus for establishing the\nachievements of the proletarian dictatorship.\n\"Hence all further conclusions. This state\nmust create special agencies for conflict with\nthe conquered class, with counter-revolution.\nThis state must have its own army and its\nown internal espionage.\n\"Thus a correct understanding of the class\nstruggle and the class state was dictated to\nas: thus spoke the experience of the former\nstate, which held so long the former power,\ndespite the fact that it was based only on H\nminority.\nA PRACTICAL QUESTION.\n\"The Workers and Peasants' Government\ncorrectly estimated the situation and estab\nlished a special agency for fighting counter\nrevolutionary disturbances in the rear.\n\"This agency was created in the form of\nthe All-Russian Extraordinary Commission\nfor Fighting Counter Revolution, speculation,\nand sabotage.\n\"The need for this agency was felt the\nmore keenly because the Soviet power had no\napparatus for spiritual transformation.\n\"The school remained as formerly. The\nteaching force and textbooks could not be\nchanged at one stroke. The school continued\nto work in its former spirit, or, at best, was\ninactive. The Church, that powerful agency\nfor confusing the free spirit, worked in its\nformer direction. The barracks needed new\nleaders.\n\"The masses of the people were still filled\nto a large degree with the old spirit, and could\nnot always break away from their foimer\nslave-like thinking, and not infrequently went\ntogether with their class enemies against\ntheir former comrades. Hence the sharp ne\ncessity for an apparatus for compulsion and\npurification.\n\"This was not a fruit of theoretical thinking,\nbut was dictated by vital necessity. It was ne\ncessary to beat those who were !eating us.\nMore than that ; it was necessary to avert pos\nsible attacks of counter-revolutionaries, to\npreserve the life of our comrades and the ap\nparatus of Soviet power. Only hypocrites or\nidiots would deny the necessity of a special\norgan for fighting the counter-revolution. . .\n\"The Extraordinary Commission now has\nbehind it just two years of work. This work\nspeaks for itself. Our task is to show this\nwork in its broad outline. Then let every read\ner judge for himself whether the Soviet\npower needed this apparatus or not.\nTHE COMMISSION'S SCOPE.\n\"The sphere of work of the Extraordinary\nCommission was defined by the activities of\ncounter-revolutionary elements. But since\nthere is no sphere of life into which counter\nrevolutionaries did not penetrate and give\nevidence of their destructive work, the Ex\ntraordinary Commission frequently had to in\nterfere decisively in every sphere of life: in\nfood supply, in transportation, aviation, the\nRed Army, the fleet, the militia, the schools,\nconsulates, indusiry, distribution, etc.\n'The Extraordinary Commission had to\nconcern itself not alone with direct counter\nrevolutionary activity. There are deeds com\nmited quite without the intention directly to\nharm the Soviet power, but simply for per\nsonal advantage, not considering the conse\nquences. Such tLh speculation, malpractce m\noffice, banditisri, desertion. But since such\ndeeds do the Bviet power no less narm man\nvolutionary activitis, they\nby the Extraordinary Com-\nlan the former.\"\ndirect countei\nwere prosec\nmission no I\nDEA1 INW OLD OFFICIALS.\nAt this poi\nin detail the\nagainst obstr\nspeculation,\ndesertion, anc\nportant sectioi\nselected for\nstructionist\nthJ report begins to take up\niivities of the commission\nMiomsm, counter-revolution,\npractice in office, banditism,\nv like. Only the more mi-\nU- general interest have been\n''cation here. Concerning ob-\ny old officials, the report\nsays :\n\"The Sovie\nto work. This\niwer had to force the officials\nsk the All-Russian Extraor\ndinary Commission for Fighting the Counter-\n. . .. 1 i.1 J.1\nrevolution wX'K upon useu, ana uie iusk was\nnot a light one.\nAt first the bourgeoisie paid the former\nofficials salaries not to work. Thus, when on\nthe 15th of NoVmber, 1917, there began a\nstrike of all the workers in credit institutions,\nthe central administration of the All-Russian\nUnion of Credit Society Workers organ\nized for the support of the strikers a centr d\nstrike committee. This represented a coalition\nof all groups, beginning with Mensheviks\n(right wing of the Social-Democratic party)\nand ending with Kadets (Constitutional Dem\nocratic party), and in it the chief role was\nplayed by the Mensheviks. A fund for com\nbating the Soviet power was established.\n(Here follows an recount of the method of\ncollection of the fund).\n\"Only by depriving the officials of this\nmaterial aid was it possible,.by exerting pres\nsure through their stomachs, to force them\nto submit to the new power. In the second\nmonth of the existence of the Soviet power it\nwas finally possible to destroy the source of\nthe fund: and the officials began to get to\nwork-.\n\"However, obstruction did not cease. Offi\ncials often did not work as they should or\nworked in ways harmful to the Soviet power.\n\"Obstructionists m iiot by us and put in\nprison ; but, deiTfthff, they still conceal\nthemselves from us in considerable numbers\nand disorganize our apparatus for food supply\nand transport. Such activity is nothing less\nthan counter revolutionary. It was so consid\nered by the Extraordinary Commission, and\nobstructionists were punished without mercy.\nTo this struggle the commission devoted its\nbest energies, and is working now in various\ninstitutions. There is only one way to get rid\nof this sore burn it out with a red hot iron.\nThis the commission is doing.\nFIGHT WITH COUNTER REVOLUTION.\n\"The October revoluton turned the entire\nformer world upside down ... The former\nslave, the worker, or peasant became master,\nand the former master became his subject. . .\nThe land was ceded to the peasants The\nfactories were turned over to the whole\npeople. Large capital funds were confiscated\nin favor of the state. Debts were cancelled.\n\"Thus the former pomiestchik (estate own\ner) was left without land and income, the\nformer manufacturer without profits, the\nbanker without percentages, and the Czarist\nbureaucrat without power, place, or money.\nThey did not relinquish the hope of restoring\nthe old order and went to work for the over\nthrow of the Soviet power.\n\"All this brotherhood constituted the direct\ncounter-revolutionaries, those who know what\nthey are after and why, and who cannot fail\nto fight with their foes the worker and peas\nant, who pushed them out of the saddle.\nMODERATE SOCIALISTS ARE STUPID.\n\"But there is another sort of counter-revolutionaries\nthose who are counter-revolutionaries\nfor lack of clear thought.\n\"These are people often sincerely desiring\nthe victory of the working class, but not com\npreheding how to achieve it. These are all the\n'Socialistic' parties consenting to an agree\nment with the enemies of the working class,\nthe bourgeoisie. There are several such par\nties among us: Right Socialist-Revolutionaries,\nLeft Socialist-Revolutionaries and Mensheviks.\n\"They do not believe in the power of the\nworking class and therefore wish to bargain\nwith its class enemy, the bourgeoisie. They\nforget that civil war is war not for life but\nto the death, in which prisoners are not taken\nand agreements are not made, but the op\nponent is beaten down.\n\"The work of the Extraordinary Commis\nsion is thus divided into two parts the fight\nwith the direct counter-revolutionaries and\nthe fight with those who are counter-revolutionaries\nfor lack of clear thought.\n\"With the first counter-revolutionaries the\nPetiograd Revolutionary Military Committee\nhad to fight. After our first victory the of\nficers immediately started an uprising\nbut they were crushed and arrested and sent\nto their homes in the provinces. After the\nPeople's Commissariats and the institution of\nthe Extraordinary Commission had been set\nup, the fight passed from the Revolutionary\nCommittee to the Extraordinary Commission.\n\"In December, 1917, was liquidated a counter-revolutionary\nunion under the name of\n'Saving of the Motherland and the Revolu\ntion.' \"In January began the fight against the\nadventure in the Don region.\n\"At the same time was inaugurated a new\ncounter-revolutionary organization under the\nname 'Union of the Constitutional Conven\ntion.' \"After the dispersal of the counter-revolutionary\nConstitutional Convention, which re\nfused to ratify the Declaration of the Rights\nof the Free Working People, the activity of\nthe counter-revolutionaries was intensified.\nCONTER-REVOLUTIONARY CATALOGUE\nAmong the affairs further listed and dis\ncussed in detail in the pamphlet are \"The En\nlistment of Polish Legionaries in Murman.\"\nthe \"Lockhart Affair\" (Lockhart was a spe\ncial British emissary in Soviet Russia, who\ncarried on negotiations with the Bolshevik\nGovernment and was accused of aiding plans\nto overthrow them at the same time, including\nproposals to blow up railroad bridges and dis\norganize food and raw material supply) ; a\n\"White Socialist-Revolutionary Plot\" in Mos\ncow, an \"All Russian Monarchist Military\nUnion,\" the organized attacks of assassins on\nthe SovieUeaders Lenine, Uritzky, and Vo\nlodarsky the second of whom was killed, and\n\"counter-revolutionary plots\" in Ryazan, Ko\nstroma, Vishne-Volochka ; a \"Black Hundreds\nPlot\" in Velizha ; various plots in Kiev, Sara\ntov, Chernigov, and Astrakhan; the union of\n\"Great United Russia,\" the \"Southern Ar\nmy,\" the \"Romanov Order,\" the \"United Of\nficers' Organization,\" the \"Polish Military\nOrganization,\" the \"Monarchist-Socialist-Revolutionary\nOrganization,\" revolts in Kra;\nnaya Gorka and Kronstadt, the \"National\nCentre\" (alleged to have l)een an organization\nof spies of the Entente Allies and Denikine),\nthe \"Military Organization of the Staff of the\nVolunteer Army,\" and various activities of\nofficials of the Greek Orthodox Church,\nwhich had been the state Church of Russia,\nfor the purpose of creating sentiment against\nthe Soviett Government.\nThere follows a criticism of the \"counter\nrevolutionaries for lack of clear thought, or\nthrough stupidity.\" In this category are in\ncluded the Socialist Revolutionaries and the\nMenshevik Social-Democrats,- who held the\nreins of the administration up to the Bolshe\nvist seizure of power. These parties are cri\nticised for having formed coalition govern\nments with bourgeois parties, for having con\ntinued the war against Germany, and for\nhaving imprisoned Bolsheviks who argued in\nfavor of seizure of power \"by the workers\nalone.\" From the time of the Bolshevist over\nthrow of the Provisional Government, says\nthe pamphlet, began the \"mad activities of\nthe Right Socialist Revolutionaries.\"\nSimilarly, the Left Socialist-Revolutionaries\nare attacked as 'counter-revolutionaries'\nfor opposing the Soviet Government in con\nnection with the signing of the separate peace\nwith Germany at Brest-Litovsk. They are\ncharged with' having formed secret \"fighting\nstaffs\" to organize revolts and to seize and\nhold Soviet officials and disorganize their\npower.\nAmong alleged Left Socialist-Revolutionary\nplots are listed revolts in Veliki Luki, Chem\nbara, Mstislavi, Kazan and Ryazan and plans\nfor explosions in Moscow, Including the Krem\nlin. The Mensheviks are characterized as \"a\nparty of dreaming commoners, a party of in\nvertebrate intellectuals, consisting of people\nwho do not believe in their own strength and\nwho consider that the people, the workers,\nand peasants, are not capable of administering\n'a state, that they have not developed to that\npoint.\" They are accused of fomenting agita\ntion against the Soviet power in Petrograd\nand Moscow, of organizing strikes, and of\nparticipating in the Siberian Government of\nKolchak and supporting the \"Committee for\nthe Constitutional Convention\" of the Sama\nra Government.\nA few paragraphs are also devoted to the\nanarchists, who appear to have opposed the\nSoviet Government as actively -and consist\nently as logical anarchists oppose any form of\ngovernment. There is a description of the\nfight in which Soviet forces captured by\nstorm, after artillery fire, the \"Anarchist\nHouse\" on the Malaya Dmitrovka in Moscow,\nand of fights with anarchist bands in various\nprovinces of Russia.\nThen follow charges of brutalities commit\nted by antagonists of the Soviet power in\ndealings with Bolshevists captured in the\ncourse of the various anti-Soviet campaigns,\nand descriptions of the struggle against spe\nculation, crimes committed in office by Soviet\nofficials, and desertions from the Red Army,\nopposition by well-to-do peasants, especially\npeasant moneylenders, and various village re\nvolts.

There follows a \"con\nclusion,\" which sums up the case as follows:\n\"By a decree of the All-Russian Central\nExecutive Committee Soviet Russia is de\nclared to be a military camp in a state of\nsiege. This emphasizes the truth that in a\ncivil war the whole country is one united\nfront. We have lived all the time as on a vol\ncano. Counter-revolutionary elements, -reinforced\nby. all the dissatisfied and short-sigh t\ned, organize militarily and threaten to burst\nforth from their illegal positions and over\nwhelm the Soviet power by raising a revolt.\nIf there had not been the Extraordinary\nCommissions, detecting and warding off such\nendeavors, We should long ago have ceased to\nexist.

The whole process of com\nplete fusions of the Trade Unions with the\nState organs (the process which we call stati\nfication of Trade Unions) must take place as\nthe inevitable result of their joint close and\nharmonious working, and the preparation by\nthe Trade Unions of the broad masses of the\nworkers for the task of managing the State\nmachine and all the administrative organs.\"\nThe perspective outlined by the Second Con\ngress was subjected to a new test.A year and\nthree months of stem civil war passed, and\nwhatever the trials of the Trade Unions, with the\nexception of an insignificant minority, they\nfought shoulder to shoulder with the Soviet Gov\nernment against the Russian and world counter\nrevolution. It was this organic connection with the\nSoviets.\" The second important resolution lays\nCongress advanced in the first instance. \"The\nTrade Unions in Soviet Russia says the first re\nsolution practically became an inseparable part\nof the Soviet system, a necessary supplement and\nsupport of the proletarian dictatorship of the\nSoviets.\" The second important resoultion lays\nit down that \"theTrade Unions are the funda\nmental basis of the proletarian state, the sole\norganizers of labor in the process of production\nand the chief tool in economic construction.\" These\ntw definitions give an exhaustive description of\nthe Trade Uions in the period of transition from\nCapitalism to Socialism. The Trade Unions\nare the foundation and support of the Soviet\nState a necessary supplement to the organs\nof proletarian dictatorship the Soviets, the\nchief tool of economic construction and the only\norganizer of labor in the process of production.\nThese are the functions and the place of the\nTrade Unions in the proletarian State based on\nthirty months' experience of joint work and\nstruggle, and this experience was fixed by the\nresolutions of the third all-Russian Congress.\nFORCING DOWN WAGES.\nBy Nate L Welch.\nUnemployment with attending privations is the\ngrowing fear of industrial workers here in De\ntroit. In spite of reassurances by the Board of\n''Commerce fear is gnawing at the vitals of the\nworkers lest they lose their jobs in the drive of\nthe opulent wealthy to reduce wages and labor\nstandards.\nIt is estimated that 50,000 are out of work here\nand many are leaving the city. The most striking\nsign of unemployment is the number of dwellings\navailable for workers at reduced rates. Until very\nrecently rooms were so scarce -that thousands of\nfamilies were compelled to live indents on the\noutskirts and rents were screwed up to tho\nhighest point.\nFrom reliable authority it is learned that the\nGeneral Motors laid off about 30 per cent of its\noffice force and 20 per cent of its shop em\nployes. The Timken-Axle Company is reported to\nhave laid off 20 percent of its office force and\n20 per cent of its shop men. The Packard concern\nis reported to have laid off SO per cent of its\noffice force and about 25 per cent of its\nmechanics.

C. A. K. Martens\nand His Associate\nDiplomats\nLUDWIG C. A. K. Martens, unrecognized Bolshevik\n\"ambassador,\" and his \"embassy\" in New York\nfigured prominently in the week's news. On the\nday of Attorney General Palmer's assertion that we\nmay expect to expedience new bomb outrages in the near\nfuture came the statement that the Lush legislative com?\nmittee, which is investigating seditious activities in this\nstate, has discovered evidence said to connect Martens\nwith the activities of extreme radicals. The committee\nis now working on the theory that Martens, instead of\nbeing merely a. commercial agent for the Soviet govern?\nment of Russia, is in reality the head of a clearing house\nfor Red propaganda.\nThis committee teas created to investigate sedition in\nthe United. States.\nGeneral Charles D. Newton and Senator Lusk began\nthe building of a case against the local Soviet \"embassy\" by\nusing the documents and correspondence seized June 12,\nwhen a raid ivas staged by detectives and state troopers.\nAs a. result of this down-sivooping, a truckload of pam?\nphlets, letters and other documents was taken possession\nof by the authorities; and efforts of the Soviet bureau last\nweek to recover this assortment failed when Magistrate\nAlexander Brough denied a petition presented by George\nGordon Battle, who is attorney for the bureau, that the writ\nupon ivhich the seizure was conducted be declared illegal.\nAnother hearing will be held next Tuesday.\nWhat folloics here is an interesting picture of the head?\nquarters of \"Ambassadoj-'' Martens, in the World Tower\nBuilding.\nBy Louis Kantor\nONE PAY after they were raided\nI opened the door leading to\nthe offices of the \"Russian\nSoviet Government Bureau\"\nend beheld a veritable bedlam. The\n. raiding party, it was apparent, had\ndone a complete job. Nothing had\nbeen forgotten, and everything had\nI been examined. Papers of all sizes\nwere strewn on the cement floor;\ndesks, chairs and files were bunched\ntogether in topsy-turvy fashion; and\nthe atmosphere was charged with ir?\nritation. For the Soviet officials were\nfrankly annoyed and did not hesitate\nto say bo in rather strong language.\nThey ?yen hinted broadly that they\nwould take action.\nYet only two day? later I noted im?\nmediately upon my arrival that th<\natmosphere had cleared, and that th<\nsign \"Business Temporarily Discon\ntinued During Alterations\" had beei\nreplaced by the very visible \"Busi\nness Going On as Usual.\" All wa\nnormal and even the telephone opera\ntor bad recovered her verve and pai\nas little attention as possible t\nvisitors.\nI had visited these offices ofte\n?taca Ludwig C. A. K. Martens had ei\ntablished his \"embassy\" late lai\nMarch in the World Tower Buiidini\nThese are ordinary offices in an ord\nnary office building. They are no di\nferent than any one of a score i\nstock brokers' offices. The receptit\nroom is ?imply a reception room si\n?ven has a stand of ?pring water wi\naccompanying sanitary paper cups.\nA? X sat there * number of men hi\neome in and were making their bui\ni\nI ness known to the telephone operator.\nA word about these men. They were\non the whole well dressed?one of\nthem wore white spats?and looked\nlike prosperous business men who were\nthere for no other purpose than to\nsoil their wares.\nAt this point it may be interesting\nto rehearse briefly the history of the\nSoviet Bureau in order to explain the\npresence of American business men in\nthe local offices of the Bolsheviki.\nWhen Ludwig Martens announced late\nlast March that he was the official\nrepresentative of L?nine in the United\nStates he was unknown, except per?\nhaps to a few business intimateB and\nSanteri Nuotteva. It was at the of?\nfices of the latter, in 299 Broadway,\nthat he first issued this announcement.\nHis credentials, which he made pub?\nlic at the time, were signed by the\nSoviet Minister, of Foreign Affairs,\nGeorge Tchitcherin, and bore the seal\nof the Russian Soviet government.\nThese documents stated that the Rus?\nsian citizen L. C. A. K. Martens was\nappointed \"representative of the Rus?\nsian Socialist Federal Soviet Republic*\"\n?the officiai title of the Bolshevik\ngovernment?and were also accom?\npanied by a birth and citizenshib cer?\ntificate, and also with instruction? to\npresent the \"character and the posi?\ntion\" of the Russian Soviet govern?\nment before the American government\nin order to establish commercial re?\nlations between the two countries\nThese instruction? also stated the\nmanner in which th? Soviet govern?\nment was prepared to pay for pur?\nchases. Marten? also announced thai\nay At\nhe had received an amount of money\nsufficient to establish a bureau and to\ncarry on the preliminary work for ob?\ntaining the recognition of his govT\nernment.\nNow, what is more important than\nany other part of Martens's announce?\nment was the fact that he stated that\n$200,000,000 had been placed aside in\nMoscow to be shipped to the United\nStates for the payment of purchases\nmade as soon as permission to trade\nwith the United States could be ob?\ntained. For Russia at that time as\nwell as the present time is surrounded\nby an Allied blockade.\nMartens announced that he had sent\nthese credentials to the State Depart?\nment After a great deal of wordy\ntalk and correspondence it was learned\ndefinitely that the credentials were\nnever acknowledged.\nIn due time Martens opened his of?\nfices, established a commercial, depart?\nment, and began the placing of tenta?\ntive contracts. Thus for a short\nperiod the Soviet bureau proceeded\nmerrily to obtain business, and all was\nwell?temporarily.\nIt was a curious state of affairs. In\nSiberia American forces were battling\nwith the Bolshevik! and in New York\nCity, American business forces were\ndiscussing business with representa?\ntives of the Bolsheviki. To a few\nAmericans this seemed somewhat il?\nlogical if not objectionable, and they\nasked the government about it. It fell\nto Frank Polk, Acting Secretary of\nState, to make an answer.\nIn an official statement that he is?\nsued he said very pointedly that Mar?\ntens had not been recognized, and that\nthe State Department advised Ameri?\ncan business to go slow and to be very\ncautious in their dealings with him or\nmembers of his bureau. I was sent\nto see Martin? to find out whether the\nannouncement has had any effect on\nthe bureau's business and was referred\nto A. A. Heller, the commercial at?\ntach? of the bureau. Heller's office\nwas on the floor above. The Soviet\nbureau has two suites of offices on\nseparate floors of the same building.\nThe typewriting macnines were busily\nclicking as ,1 made my way to an in?\nformation desk and told a young wom?\nan what I wanted. Heller's office I\ncould see as I waited to see him, had\na \"we mean business\" air about it\nthat was unmistakable. In a short\ntime I was taken to Heller's desk and\nwas told by him that he had been\ninformed already by Martens as to the\nnature of my business.\nHeller, as I have since learned, is an\nAmerican citizen, attended Harvard\nUniversity, was in the jewelry business\nin Paris for a number of years, and\nis the founder of the International\nOxygen Company, in New Jersey. He\nis seemingly of a quiet nature and is\nnot talkative. I also understand that\nhe is very wealthy. His appearance is\ndistinctly American.\nAt that time Heller told me that\nFolk's announcement had had no ap?\nparent effect on the bureau's business,\nand that he was willing to give me the\nnames of some of the business firms\nwith which the bureau was negotiating\nfor business. He gave me the names\nof about six and I went to see all of\nthem.\nI saw all aix, but I shall relate only\nwhat on? of them toM m?. Ha waa the\nOur I\nj representative of one of the largest\ntextile firms in this country, and was\nquite frank about the whole matter.\n\"Yes,\" he said in answer to my ques?\ntion, \"I have been to see those people,\nbut that does not mean that I sympa?\nthize with their beliefs. As a matter\nof fact, I don't. But look here, my\nconcern has been manufacturing cloth\nfor the government exclusively during\nthe war. Now that means that we\nhave not been able to take care of\nour own trade. The war is over, and\nwe have to fight to regain what smaller\nfirms took away from us during the\nj war. So that if these people say they\nhave cash and want to buy our goods,\nwe'll sell them. But only for cash?\nno credit. We're in business for busi?\nness.\"\nSo coming back to the present, that\nin no small measure accounts for the\npresence of these men. And the sur?\nprising thing about the whole business\nis the fact that they are coming even\nI now, when public authorities, both by\nrord and deed, have expressed their\ndeep disapproval of the bureau and are\n| about to make Martens and his at?\ntach?s the subject of an extensive in\nI quiry.\nIn time I was announced to Santerl\nNuorteva. Nuorteva is the. official\nj spokesman of the bureau and does all\nits talking. He was born in\n! Finland in 1881 of Russian-Swedish\nparentage. \"Part of the Finnish bu?\nreaucracy,\" added Nuorteva, with a\nsmile. He was graduated in 1903 from\nthe University of Helsingfors, and was\nfor a number of years an instructor of\nmodern languages in the high schols of\nFinland. He was a member of the Fin?\nnish Parliament during the years 1907\nto 1911, and was also a member of the\ninter-parliamentary committee of the\nFinnish Socialist Parliament members\nand the Russian Duma members. He\nfinally came to this country as the\nrepresentative of the Finnish Socialist\ngovernment to the United States. He\nreads twelve languages and speaks six\nand he added, \"of course I spent some\ntime in jail.\" This very proudly.\nTalking to Nuorteva is not an easy\nmatter. It seems that everything that\ncomes up in the office of Martens for\nI decisive action is referred tto the \"dip?\nlomatic representative\" which is Nuor?\nteva's official title. I told him that I\nwanted to see and know what went on\nin a Bolshevik office for a day, and was\ntold by him that I was entirely wel?\ncome to find out.\nThe routine of the Soviet offices, ac?\ncording to Nuorteva, is very simple.\nEach day a large mail is received and\nconsists respectively of letters from\nbusiness concerns, from sympathizers\nand from freaks. These letters are\ndistributed to one of the following four\ndepartments in the bureau: The dip?\nlomatic and publicity, either to Mr.\nMartens or Mr. Nuorteva; the commer?\ncial, to Mr. Heller or Evans Clark, the\nassistant director; the statistical or\nlegal to Isaac Hourwich, the coun?\nsellor of the bureau; and rout'no let?\nters to Gregory Weinstein, the chan?\ncellor.\nI asked Nuorteva whether the bu?\nreau wa? not carrying on propaganda\nin this country, and he admitted that\nit was. He explained, however, that\nit was propaganda within the \"bounds\nof diplomatic propriety.\" No interfer\n^ocal\nence in American affairs is intended\nby means of this propaganda. What\nhe could not understand, said Nuor\nteva, was the objection to the presence\nof the Soviet bureau when similar\nbureaus in this country are not mo?\nlested.\n\"At the present time,\" said Nuorteva,\n\"America is being confronted over and\nover again with the spectacle of offi?\ncial representatives of some govern?\nment actually in power in Europe, but\nwhich so far have not been recognized\nabroad. This is really nothing new.\nThere has always been even in peace\ntime this kind of problem.\n\"It is a perfectly natural thing. There\nis no reason why the representatives\nof the Soviet government, who repre?\nsent a government which has been in\npower for a year and a half controlling\na larger territory than any other gov?\nernment aspiring to recognition has\never controlled, should be kept from\npresenting their case to the American\npeople while the representatives of any\nother group or any other nation are\nnot only allowed to carry on a propa?\nganda for the recognition of their\ngovernment, but have been allowed to\ncollect funds in America for the pur?\npose of getting recognition.\"\n\"But what about Korchak?\" I inter?\njected. \"Hasn't he been recognized\nconditionally by the Allied gbvern\nments?\"\n\"It will take perhaps two months,\"\nsaid Nuorteva, with a confident laugh,\n\"for the Allies to realize that any\npolicy based on the support of Kolchak\nis bound to fail. The realization of this\nwill make them inclined finally to con?\nsider seriously the possibility of rela?\ntions with Soviet Russia, and they will\nj find that Russia is ready under the rule\nof the Soviets to maintain responsible\nrelations with the rest of the world.\"\n\"Well, since you admit that you are\ncarrying on a campaign of propaganda\nfor the recognition of Soviet Russia,\"\nI said, \"what form would you have\nsuch recognition take?\"\n\"The propaganda conducted by the\nRussian Soviet Government Bureau,\"\nreplied Nuorteva slowly, \"has had as\nits only object the establishment of\ntrade relations between Soviet Russia\nand the United States. We are not so\nmuch concerned with political recogni?\ntion.\"\nThe interview thus far had not been\nconducted with felicity, for Nuorteva\nwas being constantly interrupted by\ncallers and telephone calls, and was\naway to write an editorial for \"Soviet\nRussia,\" which the Martens bureau is\nnow issuing,\nIn consequence, during the lull in\nour interview, I called on Mr. Martens?\nor rather Comrade Martens, as the tele?\nphone operator calls him; or, if you\nknow Russian, the word is \"Tovarisch.\"\nIt is not necessary to repeat the. life\nhistory of Martens, for of recent date\nit has been done frequently. He is an\nextremely quiet man, one might even\ncall him shy. He rarely sees reporters,\nalthough he speaks English quite\nfluently. We spoke about the raid and\nthe only comment that he had to make\nwas that it was all a \"mistake.\" His\nwork is principally supervision?Bol\nsheviki evidently believe in supervisors,\neven though their chiefs are called\n\"comrade\" by the telephone operator\n| and office boy, not to forget the stenog\n3olshe\nraphers?and he is rarely seen out o:\nhis private office.\nThe chancellor, or chief clerk, Greg\nory Weinstein, is certainly not a quie'\nman. He may be heard all over th?\noffices. He was born in Vilna, Russia\nin 1880, and was graduated from th?\nTeachers Institute in ?that country\n\"We went to jail,\" is the laconic way he\nput it, \"for revolutionary activities\n\"Let me see,\" he said, reflectively\n\"The last time I went to jail was wher\nI was sent to Siberia in 1905.\" He es?\ncaped from Siberia the same year and\nwent to Switzerland in 1906. He was\ngraduated from the University of Gene?\nva in 1911 as master of law and as mas?\nter of social science. He came to the\nUnited States in 1913, and acted as the\neditor of \"Novy Mir,\" the local Russian\nSocialist daily, the rest of the time. It\nwas on this paper that Leon Trotsky\nacted as associate editor.\nWeinstein is in charge of the \"help\"\nand manages the outer offices. He is of\nan extremely belligerent nature and\neasily excited. He doesn't like re?\nporters and always greets them coldly.\nTo him they are pests to be borne with\npatience.\nThe most picturesque figure of all\nis Isaac Hourwich, the counsellor of the\nbureau. He was born in Russia and is\na graduate of Petrograd University.\nHe was professor of economics at Chi?\ncago University and received a degree\nof Doctor of Philosophy from Columbia\nUniversity. He was connected with the\nDepartment of Labor as chief statisti?\ncian, and is considered an authority on\nimmigration, having written a book on\nthat subject which is used universally\nin most of the colleges in the country.\nHe is also one of the most popular\nfigures on the Jewish East Side.\nWhen I entered his office he was\nseated in shirt sleeves and busily at\nwork. I spoke with him for a time\nabout his work, which is the accumu?\nlation of statistics about Russia and\nAmerican business, until finally he told\nme that he was busy and was very\nanxious to continue, saying, \"You see,\neven' if I do work for the Bolsheviki I\nam a wage slave just the same.\" A\ntruly jovial and frank figure.\nAs I was departing I saw Nuorteva\nagain for a moment and asked him\nwhether the bureau had succeeded in\nplacing many contracts, and his reply\nwas that it had. He made plain, how?\never, that these contracts were tenta?\ntive and dependent upon the lifting of\nthe blockade. \"The whole development\nof the Russian revolution,\" he declared,\n\"depends upon the establishment of\ntrade relations with the rest of the\nworld. There, has been absolutely no\ncamouflage about it. We have been\nready and still are ready the very\nminute the blockade will be lifted to\nbuy American goods for hundreds of\nmillions of dollars and to pay for them\nin cash.\n\"The American public,\" he concluded\nwith emphasis, \"must realize that in\nthe establishment of trade relations\nwith Soviet Russia is the only possible\nway of establishing trade with Russia.\nKolchak's rule is in a territory the\npopulation of which is very small and\nunable to absorb the products, and it is\na fact that there is more chaos and dis?\nruption in his territory than there is\nin any other part of Russia. The rec?\nognition of Kolchak would mean the\nvist Embassy\n|Effects of the Raid Soon\nt Cleared ? ?. \" Business\nas Usual \" I\n? throwing of Russia into years of ever\n. increasing chaos, which certainly would\ni be an insurmountable obstacle to any\n? trade relations. The business men of\n1 America seem to realize that quite well,\n; and most of those firms who were will?\ning to trade with Soviet Russia also\nevinced a desire to use their influence I\nas American citizens to lift the block?\nade.\"\nI was frankly disappointed with the\nSoviet officers. No long-haired men,\nno dreamers and no idealists. Ap\nparently only hard-headed business\nmen anxious to establish trade rela?\ntions with Russia. I had an idea from\nsomewhere that the Bolsheviki would\ndiminish the hours of work, a sort of\nmillennium, and yet Nuorteva's secre?\ntary spoke feelingly about her over?\ntime work. The whole experience is\nfrankly disillusioning. The offices of\nL. C. A. K. Martens are just ordinary\nbusiness offices. No wonder the local\nLeft Wing of the Socialist party asked\nfor Martens's recall.\nI An Aerial Leviathan to Cross the\nAtlantic in Twelve Hours ^\nAN AERIAL leviathan of the\nbat - wing type, without a\nstrut or a stay wire, expect?\ned to travel at the rate oi\n250 miles an hour, has been de?\nsigned, and may be in course oi\nconstruction, according to Williarr\nDinwiddie, an unofficial investigatoi\nof the aircraft industry.

He writes\n\"A three-hundred-foot wing-spai\nbat-wing, cantilever airplane would b\ncapable of lifting an effective load c\nfrom fifty to seventy thousand pounds\nthat? is, deadweight freight, closely an\ncarefully packed to approximate twei\nty-five tons, could be transported i\nthe monster. Twelve hours, or eve\nless, for transatlantic flights may sour\nlik- the romances of Munchausen, bi\nthe non-parasite resistance airplane i\nthe bat-wing type, or some modifie\ntion of its form, is firmly believed 1\ncertain air engineers to be the Tin\nsolution of the air-speed problem.\n\"There are a number of very radie\nplans in the hands of designers of ai\ncraft that are expected to revolutio\nize the whole art of flying, and whit\nit is hoped by the more enthusiast\nleaders, will give us air transport?t!\non a truly economic basis. The desig\nembrace the double conception of i\nducing air resistance and thereby i\ncreasing gas consumption, togetr\nwith construction which will g\nstrength and freight-carrying capaci\n\"The best of these ideas, and the c\nwhich will probably be next in 1\nrapid advance of the art of flying,\napparently a huge monoplane, withi\na strut or a stay wire or a fuselage\nan undercarriage visible in flight,\nis just a mammoth wing or wings;\nyou like, something in the nature o\nbat with its head removed.\n\"It is to be built on the cantile\nbridge principle. At the nose of\nforward centre of the 'plane t\nbridgework will be five or six f\nhigh, tapering each way to the\ntremities of the wings. From\nfront to the back or from the head\nthe tail the same cantilever bri\nconstruction is used. Toward the\nthe machine narrows, or it may be\nout into a definite tail feature, 1\n1 the present 'planes. The tail of the\n| machine is equipped with the usual\n' balanced rudder and elevators.\n\"The engines and propellers are\nspaced equally apart from the nose of\nthe machine. The radiators, instead of\nbeing vertical, are placed in a nearly\nhorizontal position, so that they offer\nlittle resistance to the air, and the\nwind rushing over them sucks tne air\nI through them instead of pushing it\n| through as in an ordinary 'plane.\n\"The undercarriage, or landing\nj wheels, make their appearance only\ni when the machine is on the ground or\nabout to land. Once in the air, they\nj are promptly pulled up into the body\n| of the machine to reduce wind resist?\nance. The whole of this structure is\ncovered with fabric or metal sheets.\n\"In flight we have a huge, headless\npair of wings, with the front edge\nj rounded in a graceful curve, stretch?\ning sidewise to almost feather-like\nedges on the ends, and backward in a\nslightly bowed curve to the tail con?\ntrols. As it purringly cleaves the air\nthere will not be a thing in sight ex?\ncept the burnished wings of this\nmonster. The cantilever 'plane can be\nbuilt watertight, so that, except in\nextremely severe weather, it can float\nsafely on the surface of the ocean\nindefinitely, if adversity forces a\nwatery landing.\"\nTo-Dav\ni\n<<YESTERDAY>\" w\"tes Arthur\n-*?

All the organs of the union are elected by a\nspecial Conference, in which all members part\nicipate either through delegates (national, gov\nernment, ouyezd) or Conferences, of general\nmembers on the Farms.\nConferences of representatives of the union are\nsummoned, besides the conferences called to de\ncide Economic and aministrative questions. Up to\nthe present time there has been one All-Russian\nConference, in the end composed of the rep\nresentatives of the management Committees of\nthe Provincial Departments, and the most im\nportant Districts Departments. In Provinces and\nDistricts the Conferences of the Committees are\nheld not less than once a month, and General Con\nferences twice a year.\nIn the Central Committee and in the Manage\nment Committee of Provincial Departments, these\nare the following Departments: The Secretariat\nwith an organizing Sub-department, the Standard\nization of Wages, Protection of Labor and Edu\ncational Departments. The Controlling Depart\nment is not yet organized either in the centra,\nor in the Districts.\nThe following Commissions are formed in con\nnection with the Workers Committees: wage fix\ning, Educational Commissions.\nThe Workers Committees have wage, labor pro\ntection, and Educational Sub-Committees, al\nthough the latter exist only on large - Soviet\nestates which employ a large number of workmen.\nSoviet Farms which are of recent formation have\na common Workers Committee the workers\nCommittees in these cases have not been aban\ndoned. The Task of the Union.\nThe chief object of the Landworkers Industrial\nUnion, has been:\n1) The organization of agriculture on Commun\nist principles propagating their idea among the\npeasants. 2) the increase of efficiency by approp\nriate means and planned organization, the .expul\nsion of parasitic elements, and the establishment\nof strict Labour discipline. 3) the protection of\nLabor on the Soviet Farms. A) , educational work\namong the agricultural workers, to give first place\nto abolishing illiteracy and to organize Agricul\ntural schools.\nThe participation of the union in the organ\nization of agriculture took the fonn chiefly in\norganizing the labor of the workers, the establish\nment of Control and Management, and the direct\nparticipating in management by putting foreward\nthe best workers in the union for lesponsible\nposts in the management.\nThe greatest attention is now given to the or\nganization of model Soviet farms as the union is\nconvinced that the success of the propaganda in\nfavor of agriculture on communist principles, de\npends on the organization of Farms which may\nserve as an example to the peasants. To carry\nout successfully this task an information depart\nment has been formed which collects all the data\nrelating to agriculture; this data is applied when\nworking out agricultural plans, controlling etc. and\nalso when calculation of the technical forces,\n(this work is just being organized), in order that\nthe fullest and best use be made of them. The\nlocal control or production, is carried out by the\nwoi.. jrs Committees on the various undertakings,\nwnich elect wage and standardization of Labor\nCommittees to standardize labor and wages ac\ncording to the instructions of the Central organs\nof the union; it controls the labor discipline, and\nthe proper execution of plans and protection of\npublic property, but the committees do not inter\nfere with the technical administration of the in\ndustry which belongs exclusively to the Manage\nment.\nThe following figures give a characteristic view\nof the work of the union in connection with the\norganizing Soviet estates:\nAccording to statistics provided by the Commis\nsariat of Agricutlure, previous to the advance\nof Denikin there were 33 governments in Central\nRussia, 2463 Soviet estates with a total area\nof 1,361,490 desiatins of which 745,536 was\nploughed land and 313,354 was arable.

French Draws\nParallel Between .\nSoviet and Other\nManagements\nRADICALS WRONG\na\nGives Complete Story\nof Structure of Rus\nsian Regime\n* The Hon. Burton L. French is not\nso often heard on the .floor of the\nhouse of representatives, but if he\nspends his time always as well as he\ndid in preparing a recent speech, his\nsilence is to be preferred to the.\nspeech making of many others.\nOn December 9 Mr. French deliv\nered to the house one of those com\nprehensive and sensible talks on a\n\"hot\" subject that become valuable\ndocuments to a nation. His subject\nwas bolshevism and his speech a\n\"partial analysis of the Russian\nsoviet constitution.\" As far as we\ncan learn the American people now\ncall by the name of bolshevism that\nframe of mind allowing the soviet\nform of government, hut perhaps\nthat is giving bolshevism the advant\nage. It is the soviet idea, however,\nwhich is causing the active rever\nberations of radicals all over the\nworld, and Mr. French had a very\ntimely subject.\nHis method was that of plain de-'\nscription and the \"deadly parallel\"\nas he called it. He held up the de\ntails of soviet management in Rus\nsia alongside the details of demo\ncratic management of affairs in the\nynited States, and democracy rose\nseveral degrees in comparison. Mr.\nFrench was thoro. Nobody having\naccess to the Congressional Record\nof December 12 need to hold vague\nopinions as to what sovietism is and\nwhat it is not.\nIn beginning, Mr. French said:\n\"We are not surprised. when ex\nreme and radical groups of people\napplaud an extreme and radical type\nof government. We are not sur\nprised that anarchists everywhere,\nat I. W .W.'s everywhere .that the\nleft wing of the Socialist party of the\nUnited States, that the Social Demo\ncratic party in the United States, and\nsimilar organizations in other count\nries heralded with delight the soviet\ngovernment in Russia.; but we are\nsurprised when people who, we as\nsume, have accurate habits of\nthought express their opinion as\nfavorable to the soviet system.\"\nHe said he was sure that the\npostal employes' union of Minneapo\nlis had been misinformed of the facts\nwhen jt made the resolution:\n\"And whereas fully 95 per cent of\nthe population Of Russia fully sup\nports the soviet government of Rus\nsia, be it resolved that the Minne\nsota federation of labor express its\nsympathy with the soviet Russia.\"\nHe showed that the American Fed\neration of Labor was opposed to\nbolshevism and the soviet form of\ngovernment.\nOne of the principal points of ar\nraignment in this speech was that\nunder the soviet constitution in Rus\nsia the farmer is ruled against. Vot\ning is dofle by trades and crafts, in\nthe first place, and employers of\nlabor are disenfranchised. The\nfarmer standing alone and often em\nploying help in his harvesting, has\nthe lowest voting power.\nThe structure of the Russian gov\nernment under its present constitu\ntion is composed of the All-Russian\ncongress, corresponding to our own\nsenate and house of representatives.\nWe elect members to our congress\ndirectly. The Russians elect their\nmembers, about the way we elect of\nficers in the army. Members of the\nAll-Russian congress are elected by\nurban and provincial soviets, or\ngroups, which are previously elected\nby the people of the cities, in one\ncase, and the rural soviets, in the\nother. Rural soviets elected\nUllage and local soviets, which are\npreviously elected by part of the\npeople and deputies from cities,\nelected by part of the city people.\nStarting from the other end, those\nRussian farmers and villagers who\ntave the franchise vote for their\n~ural local soviet, and that Is the end\nto their participation in self govern\nment. Deputies from the cities help\nhem elect members to their rural\nlocal soviets, so their vote is diluted.\nThis local soviet helps elect the\nrural soviet, which helps to elect the\nprovincial soviet, which helps to\nelect the All-Russian congress. In\neach case the city soviets help elect\nthe various soviets. It would be the\nsame in America if our county com\nmissioners elected state legislators,\nand state legislators elected national\ncongressmen. The voter is three\ntimes removed from the selection of\nhis final law maker.\nA weak point in the whole system\nis that there is no judiciary in the\ngovernment. The men who make\nthe laws, or help make them, also\nexecute them.\nMr. French draws his deadly\nparallel as follows:\nExecutive Officers\nRussia\n1. The executive officers of all\nRissia are chosen by the All-Russian\nexecutive committee, which is chosen\nby the All-Russiaa Congress of\nSoviets, which is chosen by provin\ncial and urban soviet*, etc.\n\"(In Russia the ehief executive\nis three times removed from the city\nvoter and five times removed from\n:he rural voter.)\n2. .Regional and provincial ex\necutive officers are chosen by the re\nspective soviets, which themselves\nare not chosen by the people.\"\nUnited States\n\"The president is elected by elec\ntors chosen bv the direct vote of the\npeople to vote for a particular per\nson.\n\"(In the United States the presi\ndent is once removed from the peo\nple.)\n\"Governors are elected by direct\nvote of the people.\"\n\"The All-Russian Congress of\nSoviets is necessarily a very large\nbody and it is an unwieldy body. For\nthe purpose, then, of close executive\nadministration the constitution pro\nvides that there shall be an execu\ntive committee appointed of 200\nmembers. This executive committee\nis chosen by the All-Russian Con\ngress of Soviets. As the congress it\nself is once removed from the city\ndwellers and three times removed\nfrom the country dweller the com\nmittee chosen by the congress is two\ntimes and four times, respectively,\nremoved from these groups of Rus\nsian people.\n\"This committee then selects an\nother committee of seventeen mem\nWhy More Small Cars Come\nEquipped With Goodyear Tires\nLast year, more small cars, using 30 x 3-,\n30 x 3 V2rt or 31 x 4-inch tires, were factory\nequipped with Goodyear Tires than with\nany other kind*\nThis is plainly a result of the high relative\nvalue produced in these small-car tires by\nGoodyear's enormous resources and scrupu\nlous care.\nThey represent the same intense endeavor\nto supply utmost satisfaction in tires that\nhas laid the basis for the marked preference\nwhich exists everywhere for Goodyear Tires\nin the larger sizes.\nThis real Goodyear value in tires is available\nfor your Ford, Chevrolet, DOrt, Maxwell, or\nother stnall car, at our nearest Service Station.\nGo there for these tires and Goodyear Heavy\nTourist Tubes.\nA*\n9\no'\n0\n,0\n\u00ab\np\n>\nS\nm\n4\nEli\ns\nI\n*\ni\nMS*,\nf'y\n%\nGoodyear Heavy Tourist Tubes are thick, strong tutes that\nreinforce casings properly.

The chair\nman of the foreign affairs committee,\nthe chairman of the committees on\nthe army and the navy, become nec\nessarily the most important mem\nbers of the Russian government, and\nthe chairmanship of the foreign af\nfairs committee is the office that is\nnow filled by Lenin.

It was not until after the revolution\nof October 1917 that they saw the necessity of\nallying themselves with the city workers, the\nland workers were also carried away with the\ngeneral revolutionary enthusiasm prevailing at\nthat time. Until the revolution of 1917 the agri\ncultural workers of Russia had no union of their\nown, neither during the time of the old Russian\nfeudal system nor during the period of growth of\nthe capitalist regimes. Some attempts to organize\nthe Agricultural workers were made during the\nrevolutionary movement of 1904 5; the union of\nthe workers of Boutirsky Farm in Moscow, can be\nquoted as an example, but these were of a scatter\ned, improvised character, without any general plan\nor aim; they had no serious influence upon the\ndevelopment of the Agricultural workers organ\nization. Only after the February revolution of 1917\nwere small unions of agricultural workers started,\nchiefly in the neighborhood of the capital and the\nnear industrial Centres. This fact can only be ex\nplained by the influence of the industrial prole\ntarians of the Trade-Union who were constantly\nincreasing in numbers, and acquiring a strong\nrevolutionary spirit. But all these unions were of\na very primitive character both in their form of\norganization and in the aims they pursued. In the\nfirst place they lacked experience of organization\nwhich was very marked, and secondly the in\nfluence of the compromising leaders, who were\nmostly of the socialst revolutionary type with their\nnarrow bourgeois ideals and their agrarian pro\ngram full of contradiction and ommissions.\nThese unions in the period of their development\nduring the February revolution, aimed mainly at\nprotecting their craft interests, not realising that\nthe problem confronting agricultural workers was\nthe ownership and organization of production.\nOnly in October 1917 was an end put to this\nposition, and the illusions of craft unionism were\nthrown aside and first place was given to the pro\nblem of securig working class ownership and\norganization of the industry on communist prin\nciples. From this moment a revival took place in\nthe various Agricultural Workers' Unions which\nwere in existence. The organization of new Unions\nwere soon started in districts populated by\nan agricultural proletariat.\nThe Composition and structure of the Union.\nThe main task of the first Central Committee\nwas to organize the working masses, to attract\nthem into the Union and to set up a proper ap\nparatus. According to the rules, all agricultural\nwage workers are eligible for membership in the\nunion. At the present time the union is composed\nof workers and employees on the Soviet. Farms\n(agricultural orchards, cattle breeding, dairies,\nexperimental stations) laborers as well as special\nists working on the Soviet estates ana serving in\nth Central and Local governmental districts,\n(agricult. orchards, cattle breeding farms, dairies,\nsurveyors, etc.\nThe union is organized on industrial lines, there\nfore the workers and employees in auxiliaiy\ntrades serving the Soviet Farms i. e. workers in\nmills, blacksmith shops; also members of other\ntrades, saddlers, carpenters, joiners, locksmiths,\ntylers, coopers, shoemakers, tailors, are elegible\nfor membership.\nOn the first of January 1920 the number of\npaying members in the union were 65,000; but\nthis is only aproximate because many local sec\ntions did not give any information, owing to the\ngreat distance and bad communications. The prob\nable number of members is nearer 100,000.Accord\ning to the data of the Commissariat of Agricul\nture this number of workers were employed, on\nSoviet Farms alone. As the membership is ob\nligatory, it is quite clear that that number of\nmembers could not be less than the number of\nworkers employed in the industry.\nThe Congress organized and drew up a scheme\nfor organizing several sections of the union: such\nas Agricultural, Horticultural, Forestry, Land\nSureying etc. but it soon became evident that\nsuch subdivision was unnecessary and was there\nfore abandoned. The land surveyors particularly\nurged the need for their section, but even they\neventually abandoned this position, and the Bu-"}, "38": {"url": "https://chroniclingamerica.loc.gov/lccn/sn83030273/1920-07-15/ed-1/seq-4.json", "date": "19200715", "ocr_eng": "4\nALLIES\nFEARIG\nRED GERMANY,\nSEEKPARLEY\nProposal of Polish Armis\nliec Due to Fear of Influ\nence Nearer Hliine.\nTENSE SITUATION NOTED\nBoth German \"Wings Would\nWelcome Jtolslicvlki With\nr Open Hnndft.\nFptcial Catlt Dispatch to Tim Ben asb New\n1 Toik IIsiald.

AUGUST 13, 1921.\nPRICE FIVE CENTS.\nWorkers Urged To Demand No Political Infringement.\nLondon. The Daily Herald has re\nceived by wireless the following of\nficial manifesto to the Workers of the\nWorld from the Executive Committee\nof the Third Internationale:\n\"Soviet Russia is stricken by a\ngreat national calamity, similar to\nthat which occured in 191. The great\ndrought, continuing from March to\nJune, has caused famine and distress\nin the Volga provinces, which former\nly yielded 30 per cent, of the entire\nRussian harvest. Even seeds for the\ncoming season are non-existent. Twen\nty million people are threatened with\nhunger and death. Not only this, but\nalso next year. Famine is inevitably\naccompanied by disease, which is\nmowing down the already weakened\npeople.\n\"All these blows fall upon Soviet\nRussia at the moment when she is\nexhausted and well-nigh ryined by\nseven years of imperialist and civil\nwars ; when she is as yet unable either\nto supplement the people's economic\nstruggle by new forces or to remove\nold wreckage. Soviet Russia fought\nnd suffered for the entire interna\ntional proletariat. Her bleeding\nwounds she received in fighting the\nworld's capitalism, not alone for the\nRussian revolutionary proletariat, but\nlso for the world's workers.\n\"The capitalists of all countries,\nrealizing this, have helped the Rus\nsian bourgeoisie to attack Russia, not\nonly in an effort to save the profits\nformerly squeezed out of the Russian\npeov', but also to destroy the State\nwnich first raised the banner of the\nworking class revolution, which be\ncame a pillar of light indicating the\nway to the awakening masses of all\ncountries.\nAttack Under the Mask of Charity\",\nw .Xapftalto 3tat capitalist\nGovernments will now attempt to\nmake use of the famine in Russia\nafter being defeated by the arms of\nthe Red army and the struggle of the\nt1 HMA1AinH:A. it,..;., 1...\nr.uiuiJi.tn jiiuicuiiuu in imuu aaacm\nupon Russia to reorganize this at\ntack under the mask of charity and\nbenevolence. Part of the capitalist\npress declares openly and cynically:\n'Let the masses perish from famine\nif they will not rise against the Soviet\nGovernment.' The French Imperialist\nGovernment sends troops and muni\ntions io Poland to prepare a base for\nanother attack on Soviet Russia, which\nshall start in at the moment of deep\nest distress. The French diplomats are\nendeavoring to involve Roumania, the\nBaltic States and the Little Entente\nin these criminal designs.\n\"The English and American Gov\nernments, which once vied with each\nother in' humanitarian phraseology,\nnow pretend to know nothing about\nthe misery of the Russian people.\nHalf furtively, however, they promise\nhelp to Russia while hinting their\nreadiness to realize their promise if\nSoviet Russia will allow her affairs\nto be mapaged by their nominees andrt\nthose of the Russian counter-revolu'\ntionary bourgeoisie. This means that\nthey want the Russian working class\nto permit in return for a crust of\nbread the organization of the counter\nrevolution on Soviet soil; or, if the\nRussian working class refuses to\ncause rebellion, by starving the mas\nses of proletarian men and women of\nthe entire world.\n\"Do not forget the blood of Russian\nworkers and peasants shed for your\nsake. Do not forget the hunger which\nthey have suffered these three years\nfor the common working-class cause.\nDo not forget that counter-revolutionary\nattempts against the Russian\nproletariat are attempts against you.\nPrevent such designs by the world's\ncapitalists. Nip them in the bud.\nAgainst Any Conditions of Relief.\n\"The Communist Internationale in\nvites not only all Communist parties,\nRed trade unions and co-operators,\nbut all honest workers, Irrespective of\nparty, to force their respective Gov\nemments to understand that they will\nnot tolerate preparations for a new\nwar against Russia, and that they will\nnot allow their Governments to make\nany conditions in helping Soviet Rus\nsia. \"The Soviet Government, discarding\nall party and political considerations,\nhas already Invited the assistance of\nthe honest bourgeoisie parties, whole\nconscience and humanity have assert\ned themselves. They unjlerstvid that\nthe Soviet Government wishes to help\nall elements in distress and all sound\nlaments in Russia are ready to co\noperate with it in combating the\nfamine.\n\"But it is not only a question of\npreventing counter-revolutionary de\nsigns. The international proletariat\nmust also give active help to the Rus\nsian masses. We know you are poor\nyourselves and have not surplus\nbread; but we also know that wher\never misfortune befalls a working\nfamily the poorest workers lelp more\nreadily than the rich who indulge in\nphilanthropy.\n\"We appeal to all Communist par\nties and Red trade unions, to all labor\norganizations and parties wishing to\nhelp the Russian people, to start work\nimmediately.

Every shipload of bread\nsent by workers' organizations Into\nthe famine districts will stiffen the\ndetermination of Russian workers in\ntheir fight against famine.

The\n\"whole American people\" does not\ndemand that the Relief Commission\nshall be given practically free hand\nto dispense charity in Russia.\nThe workers of America declare\nthat to make such conditions for as\nsisting the Soviet Government in re\nlieving the acute distress of the Rus\nsian people, is not only preposterous,\nbut barbarous.\nThey declare that any one who\ndares make such conditions speaks,\nnot in the name of sympathy or\nhumanity, but with the savagery that\narose during the war and evidently\nhas not yet vanished.\nThe workers of Russia are starving.\nAfter seven years of war and three\nyears of blockade, a drought has set\nin which has burnt up the crops.\nDuring the blockade years the peas\nants could not procure the farming\nmachinery necessary to carry on in\ntense agricultural work. Millions of\nworkers were at the front, defending\nthe Revolution against imperialist\nvultures that were fighting to over\nthrow the Soviet power. Now, with no\nreserve to fall back on, with the soil\ngaping from the extreme drought, at\nleast ten million people are threaten\ned with famine.\n\"Release my seven American\ncitizens or I will starve your ten mil\nlion men, women and children!\" To\nHoover it is quite immaterial that\nsome of these imprisoned American\ncitizens have been engaged in direct\ncounter-revolutionary work against\nthe Soviet Government. One was a\nRed Cross worker, serving under\nGeneral Wraftgel against Soviet Rus\nsia. Splendid occupation this, for a\nRed Cross worker!\nTo Hoover it Is immaterial that\nwhat he demands Is that Soviet Run\nsia abrogate her laws to suit his,\nHoover's, fancy!\nHoover may forget, and the capital\nist class that he represents may want\nto forget, but the workers of Amer\nica will not forget that there are\nscores of Russians in American\nprisons, sent there because they dared\nto assert what Wilson openly but\nbelatedly said, viz., that the war was\na commercial war for commercial ad\nvantage. There are Russians in American\nprisons who were seized and arrested\nillegally. There are Russians who\nwere brutally tortured and hounded\nout of this free land for daring to be\npatriotic for their native land!\nNor does the American worker de\nmand that the Relief Commission\nshall operate at its own sweet will\nand according to its own pleasure.\nSoviet Russia is a sovereign 3tate. It\nis a government ofthe workers, with\nlaws created by and for the workers.\nInto the American worker's head there\nis constantly being hammered the\ndemand that he respect the law. The\ni.American worker now demands that,\nin aiding the workers of Russia, the\nRelief Commission shall respect the\nRussian law and abide by the regula\ntions of the Soviet authorities.\nFurthermore, although HooTer may\nnot recognize it, his agreement that\nthe Relief workers will not engage in\npolitical activity against the Soviet\nGovernment is a tacit admission that\ntheir record in this respect has not\nbeen too clean. Facts have incriminat\ned them too often. The Soviet author\nities state officially that the \"Amer\nicans imprisoned in Russia have either\nbeen convicted of crimes against the\nlaws of the country or are held as\nspies. Every case of an accusation is\nbased on documents given irrefutable\nproof of guilt and on the confessions\nof the accused.\"\nIn making the second-mentioned\ncondition, Hoover is well aware that\nhe is acting the hypocrito. He knows\nthat the Society of Friends has been\nengaged in relief work in Russia for\nsome time. They are not molested but\nare given every assistance to facilitate\ntheir work.\n' He knows that all Russians are\nworking as a unit In tjiis crisis.

The\nPolish capitalists and landlords have rejected the,\nhonorable peace proposalslof Sovnt Ku- : in t Ik\nhope of receiving assistance from world capital and\nin the belief that Soviet jiussia had exhausted all\nher strength in the struggle against counter-revolution.\nThc-y throw their troops into Soviet Russia and\nare now on the eve of a qreat military defeat. .\nTheir troops have fallen back from the Ukraine\nand White Russia, and the ttoops of Soviet Russia\nare pursuing them. The brigands of world capital,\nthe Polish landlords and capitalists, now wail that\nPoland is in great danger.\nThey are appealing to the governments of cap\nitalist countries with requests for immediate as\nsistance, so that European culture should not be\ndestroyed by the barbarians of the Russian revolu\ntion. And we see how the English Government,\nwhich armed the Poles for their criminal attack on\nSoviet Russia, which together with its allies refused\nto leave Poland when Soviet Russia proposed on\nApril 3 to begin negotiations in London we see\nhow that same capitalist England impudently threat\nens a new general attack by all the allies in the\ncase Soviet Russia does not conclude an armistice\nwith the Poles, who have advanced into Russia.\nThe directors of world capital, who are playing\nwith the destinies of peoples as though they were\ncats, now come forward as the defenders of the in\ndependence of Poland. The French Government,\nwhich in 1917 was ready to abandon Poland to the\nTsarist government of Russia if the latter would\nrecognize the French pretensions with respect to\nthe left bank of the Rhine, the English Govern\nment which frequently during the war declared\nconfidentially through its agents to the German\nGovernment that it would turn over Poland to the\nCentral Powers if German Imperialism would\nevacuate Belgium, where it would be a danger to\nEnglandall these traders in human flesh now\nshout that Soviet Russia threatens the independence\nof Poland and under this slogan are attempting\nto prepare the public opinion of the whole world\nfor a new attack on Russian workmen and peasants.\nWorkmen and workwomen of all countries! There\nis no need for us to explain to you that Soviet\nRussia does not entertain the slightest plan of\nconquest with respect to the Polish people, of Hoff\nman and Beseler. Soviet Russia was ready to con\nclude peace even with Polish capitalists, and in\norder to attain peace not only recognized the, inde-\"\npendence of Poland but ceded to Poland extensive\nborder regions. Soviet Russia is closely bound to\nthe Polish working masses by. decades of common\nstruggle. For Soviet Russia self-determination of\nthe Polish people is a sacred and inviolate right,\nand if not a single soldier defended Poland, thc\nPolish land would nevertheless remain the property\nof the Polish peaple, and the Polish people itself\nwould determine freely its own fate. .\nBut so long as there rules in Poland a band of\ncapitalist adventurers and landlords who have\ndra-n the country into a criminal military adven\nture; so long as the capitalists of the Entente\nsupply Poland with arms, Soviet Russia is in a\nstate of defensive war. Should Soviet Russia to-day\ngive the Polish White-Guardists a respite anO allow\nthem to reestablish their shattered troops and again\narm them with the assistance of the Entente, to\nmorrow Soviet Russia would be obliged once more\nto tear hundreds of thousands of her best sons\nfrom the plow and workmen's bench and send them\nto the front for a new defensive war.\nWorkmen and workwomen! If the capitalist filth\nof the whole world cries out about the attack on\nthe independence of Poland, in order to prepare a\nnew attack against Russia, you should know the\nfollowing and if! alone: Your employers tremble,\nfearine that one of the pillars of their rule, of\ntheir world system of reaction, exploitation and\noppression is falling; they fear that if white\nguardist Poland falls before the blows of the Red\nArmy, and the Polish workmen take over power\ninto their own hands, that then it will be easier for\nthe German, Austrian, Italian, and French work\nmen to free themselves from their exploiters, and\nthat the workmen of England and America also will\nfollow them. If the capitalist filth wails that danger\nthreatens the independence of Poland, it h because\nthey fear that your slavery, your involuUiry\nservitude, workmen and workwomen, may be re\nplaced by liberation from the chains of capitalist\nslavery. Therefore, it is the duty of the proletarians\nof all countries by every means to prevent the\nGovernments of England, France, America, and\nItaly from rendering any aid whatsoever to the\nPolish White-Guards. Proletarians of the countries\nof the Entente! Your governments will continue to\ntry to deceive you; they will insist, as heretofore,\nthat they are not rendering support to Poland. Q\nis your duty to stand guard at all ports and all\nfrontiers, and see to it that not a single train or\nship with food supplies or arms should leave for\nPoland. Take up your positions as jruards! Do not\nallow yourselves tc be deceived by false indications\nas to the places from which transports are being\nsent; such transports, you know, can be sent to\nPoland by roundabout routes. And when govern\nments and private capital do not give way to your\nprotests, organize strikes, act by force, and under\nno conditions help the Polish landlords and cap\nitalists to murder your Russian brothers.\nProletarians of Germany! When white-guardist\nPoland falls then the capitalists of the countries\nof the Entente will be willing to conclude peace\nwith German generals and with German capitalists;\nthey will help the latter to equip large armies of\nhired troops, and these troops will suppress the\nGerman proletariat in order to convert Germany\ninto a base of operations against Soviet Russia.\nThe capitalists of the countries of the Entente will\nnot hesitate to convert Germany into a heap of\nruins, to become the advance post for the struggle\nagainst Soviet Russia and Soviet Poland.

Not a single freight car and not a\nsingle ship should go from Germany to Poland.\nProletarians of all other countries! Remember\nthat the enemy now is white-guardist Poland. The\ntask of the present hour is to crush this enemy.\nProletarians of all countries! Remember that you\nmust not give in to the deceitful speeches of\ntreacherous or hesitating leaders of the workmen\nand to false promises of government. Now you\nmust act, and you must gather all forces in order\nto blockade Poland. You must concentrate all forces\nin order to show in fact the solidarity of the world\nproletariat with Soviet Russia.\nWorkmen and workwomen! Your solidarity with\nSoviet Russia at the same time is solidarity with\nthe Polish proletarians. The Polish proletariat,\nunder the directon of the Coirimunist Party, is\nstruggling steadfastly against the war with Soviet\nRussia. The Polish prisons are filled with our\nPolish brothers the Communists of Poland. The\ndefeats of the Polish White-Guardists arouse the\ngreatest enthusiasm in the hearts of Polish work\nmen. A wave of strikes is rising in Poland. Polish\nworkmen are striving to take advantage of the\ndefeats of their exploiters, in order to deal the last\nblow to their .weakened class enemy and in order\nto unite with Russian workmen in a common strug\ngle for freedom.\nThe blockade cf Poland will represent direct aid\nto the struggle for liberation of the Polish work- .\nmen; it is the road that will free Poland from the\nchains imposed on it by the victorious capitalists\nof London and Paris, the road to an independent\nrepublic of Polish workmen and peasants.\nThe 2nd World Congress of the Communist Inter\nnational sends you this appeal; Come out onto the\nstreets and show your governments that you will\nnot allow any assistance to white-guardist Poland\nor any intervention against Soviet Russia.

Before the Revolution\ntbe land privileges then existing, embodied in the\nTast landed possessions of the nobility, appanage,\nmonasteries, and churches, dominated economically\ntre rural population. The masses of the peasants,\nwho make up a large majority of the Russian nation\nand without whose support no Russian government\ncan survive, demanded the expropriation of the great\nlanded property and the increase of their land allot\nments. On the other hand, the socialist regime re\nquired for its success the gradual socialization of\nagriculture a process quite contrary to the private\nhusbandry of the peasants. The soviet regime, there\nfore, had before it three main tasks in the land\nquestion: to abolish entirely the land privileges' of th?\ngreat landowners, to satisfy tLe individualistic de\nmands of the peifcnnts, and to start and carry on the\nsocialization of agriculture.\nAccordingly, the earlies soviet land decree, of\nNovember 7, 3917, and of January 27, 1918, ordered\nthe expiopriation of the estates of the nobility, ap\npanage monasteries, and churches, thus establishing\nin 1913 a National Land Reserve of 13,800,000 des\nsiatine?, of which 12,800,000 were distributed for the\nprivate use of the peasants though the ownership\nremained with the state. The prerevolutionary laud\n;:)lotm?nis of the peasants remained in their possesion.\nThe Soviet Government had left at its disposal 3,000,\n000 dessiatines, mainly the large modern holdings of\nlie former landlords, the estates utilized for technical\nagricultural enterprises, and the lands with mineral\ndeposits.\nAfter this first stage oi the agrarian revolution\nthe Soviet Government in the first half of 391S made\nthe first attempts at agricultural socialization. From\nthe very beginning this work fell in two main divi\nsions: tho organisation of soviet estates and the pro\nmotion of agricultural communes and of other col\nlective agricultural enterprises not under state control.\nIn August, 1918, the Peoples Commissariat of Agri\ncu'ture published some principles and by-laws on the\norganization of communes, and on November 2, of the\nsame year the Government by a decree created a fund\nif one billion rubles for loans to collective agri\ncultural enterprises.\nIn 1918 this work was still in a state of con\nfusion. The unique policy of socialist land organization\nW3s established early in 1919 by several important\nland decrees, of which the fundamental one is the land\nla.v promulgated on February 14, 1919. This law de\nclares once more that all land is the property of the\nstate, administered by the Peoples commissariat of\nAgriculture, provincial and county land departments,\nand other government bodies. The peasants' land\nremains in their use, all the undistributed land of\nthe land reserve is excluded from private vise and\nplaced at the disposal of the state. The soviet estates\nare operated by the state, producing exclusively for\nits needs and employing only state laborers, preferably\norganized workers from the cities. The administrative\nand teehr.ieal affairs of each estate are conducted by\na specialist or a board appointed by the government\nauthorities, a labor committee having the right of\ncontrolling the economic and sanitary life of the\nlaborers.\nThe estates arc supposed to be scientifically\narranged model sgrnciltural enterprises of the highest\npossible productivity; undertaking such agricnlturnl\nand industrial activities ns dairies, stock-farms, vine\nyards, wine presses, tea, tobacco, and beet plantations;\nand equipped with experimental fields, agricultural\nschools and exhibitions, libraries and mi.seums. The\npurpose of the scheme is to make the soviet estates\nrerve as large agricultural centers for the benefit\nr.nd instruction of the peasants.\nThe agricultural communes arc collective enter\nprises voluntarily organized by a group of producers\nfrom their individual land allotments and the equip\nments nf ihoir households, or from lands and inven\ntories placed at their disposal by the soviet authori\nties; the communes are operated primarily for the\niif'ls of their paiticipants on the basis of an equal\n'collective application of their labor and communal\nconsumption of the products.\nCollective cultivation of land means, in the\nlaw, collective tillage, manuring, sowing, and harvest\ning of lands by p. whole village community or a\npart of its members who for that purpose combine\nin partnerships, sharing in the collective work with\ntheir own labor, inventories, and working animals,\nor with an inventory owned solely by the partnership.\nVillage lands not allotted to individual households\nnrc marked out for collective cultivation as well as\nprivate plots whose holders are not able to till thorn\n:.nd lands assigned for that purpose by the soviet\nauthorities from the land reserve.\nBoth the communes and the partnerships of col\nlective cultivation are to be managed by committers\nelected by the group however, they have to submit\nthemselves to certain definite plans of work pre-\nBy WILLIAM .V. D AMBIT\nscribed by the land depart ments, in order that a\nproper use of the means of production granted them\nby the Government may be insured.\nFrom the annual yield of the communes or of the\npartnerships their own collec live needs are first satis\nfied, and in the case of tl e partnerships a certain\namount is distributed for tme individual use of the\npartners. The surplus must Be delivered to the soviet\nfond-suply authorites in exchange for money loans\nand other things received fyoin the Government for\nthe operation of the enterprises, or in payment of\ntaxes and other public duties. The Peoples Commis\nsariat of Agriculture is urged by the same law to\nprovide for the communes and in general for the\ncollective agricultural association money loans, seeds,\ninventories, agronomic aid, and every possible as\nsistance. A supplementary soviet decree of February 23,\n1919, makes definite regulations regarding the award\nof the loans from the billion ruble fund mentioned\nabove. The administration of the fund is to be in tho\nhands of a special central committee under the\nauthority of the Commissariat of Agriculture, and of\nlocal committees with the land departments. The\nloans are awarded in money, agricultural implements,\nartificial manure, and other supplies, and are repay\nable in products without any accrued interest charges,\nexcept in cases when for a delay in the repay\nment a fine of one per cent a month is charged. The\nreceivers of the loans must obey in the operation of\ntheir enterprises definite rules worked out by the land\ndepartments and intended as a guaranty of a produc\ntive application of tho aid received.\nThe soviet authorities and economists ascribe\ngreat importance to each form of collective agricul\nture. The soviet estates are conceived as the basis\nof a complete socialization of agriculture on a national\nscale. The communes are also supposed in the course\nof time to become nationalized enterprises; while the\ncollective cultivation of land is regarded as a means\nof training the peasents in agricultural collectivism\nand of paving the way for ultimate combination in\ncommunes. In this conception both the communes and\nthe partnerships for collective cultivation constitute\nonly temporary, transitory ccoonmic organizations\nleading finally to the complete nationalization of\nagriculture.\nIt was inevitable that the efforts of the Soviet\nGovernment to socialize agriculture together with the\nnationalization of education should have led to the\nnationalization of agronomic instruction and of the\nlabor of agricultural specialists, whose knowledge was\ngTeatly needed by the soviet estates and other col\nlective agricultural enterprises. The agricultural edu\ncational institutions were already nationalized in 1918\nand were free to all. By a decree of February 12,\n1919, the agricultural experiment stations were taken\nover by the state. On January 30, 1919, the Soviet\nGovernment ordered a state-wide registration of all\nkinds of agricultural specialists and on March 20 of\nthe same year called them from twelve soviet pro\n\"inces of tho state.\nIt iR important to note that the Soviet Govern\nment in its efforts to collectivize the private enter\nprises of the peasants has not adopted or employed\ncompulsory methods. The first agricultural communes,\nin 1918, were started quite voluntarily by groups of\n1he poorest peasants to help themselves by coopera\ntion to survive the economic crisis and the scarcity\nof agricultural implements. Likewise the fundamental\nland law outlined here conceives the communes and\nagricultural partnerships as voluntary organizations.\nThere are other ennspicious evidences to the same\neffect. Kuraev, a prominent member of the Commis\nsariat of Agriculture, at a government corference on\nsocialist land organization in March, 1919, asserts:\n'We must inf'ueice the peasants by example, convic\ntion; but in tho work of the collectivization of agri\nculture by no means resort to force.\" And Lenin,\ntho head of the Soviet Government, at the eighth\ncongress of the Communist Party of Russia, made the\nfollowing statements: \"There is no greater stupidity\nthan the mere thought of compulsion in the field of\nthe economic relatiens of the middio peasants We\nmust convince the peasants, and convince them by\nexample. It is necessary, first of all, to prove that\nsuch a collectivization is better, that it is profitable.\"\nTo the same effect the congress demanded in a\ncomprehensive agrarian resolution a mild policy in\ncollecting taxes from the poorer peasants; a system\nartificial msmire, improved breeds of cattle; the\nof distributing to them agricultural machinery, seeds,\nestablishment of a rural credit system; the promo\nlion of home industries; and a number of other\nconomic measures. This resolution embodies the real\nsoviet policy in this question, as the Communist\nParty has been the determining political factor in the\nwork of the Soviet Government.\nThis conciliatory attitude is due mainly to two\ncircumstances. First, in matters of agricultural social\nization the application of any compulsion to the\npeasants tho majority of the people would be in\neffective and ridiculous. Second, the soviet authorities\nhold to t'e view that collective agriculture is, in\nrespect of efficiency and productivity, superior to the\nsmall individual agricultural homesteads of the peas\nants and that the practical demonstration of the\nSuperiority of the soviet estates and communes before\nthe eyes of the peasants will stimulate them to\ncombine gradually in partnerships of collective cul\ntivation of land.\nIn pursuance of the principles and methods out\nlined in the foregoing, the Soviet Government during\n1P19 has organized many new soviet estates and\npromoted the organization of agricultural communes.\nThe cultivated territory of the estates, numbering\n2,324, comprised a little short of 1,000,000 dessiatines,\nof which the whole annual produce, estimated in\nmoney amounted to 843,000,000 rulbes; it is intended\nto increase chis territory in 1920 to 2,000,000 des\nsiatines. Some inference as to the growth of tho\ncommunes may be drawn from the respective data\navailable for the provinces of Petrograd, Novgorod,\nVitebsk, Mohilev, Tula, Kaluga and Orel, where in the\nwiddle of 1919 there were in existence 1,360 communes\nwith a land area of 179,000 deesiatines.\nIn view of the vast agricultural area of Soviet\nRussia, these results, no doubt, are not extensive. Yet\nthis comparatively slow process by no means indicates\na failure of the methods employed. The war created\nsome extremely unfavorable conditions which tem\nporarily have handicapped a more rapid socialization\nof Russian agriculture. The material resources of\nthe Soviet Republic had to be devoted to the prosecu\ntion of the war forced upon the country. On that\naccount, and on account of the blockade, the worn\nout agricultural implements, particularly agricultural\nmachinery, could not be repaired in sufficient quan\ntity or replaced by new ones. The live stock was\nlargely reduced in number for the needs of the war.\nHundreds of thousands of the most skilled laborers\nwere withdrawn from agriculture to serve in tho\narmy. Under such conditions the Soviet Government\nwas able to realize only to a very limited extent\nits plans for the socialization of agriculture, since\nthe essential prerequisite for an efficient operation\nof the soviet estates and agricultural communes is\na plentiful supply of labor and of live stock, and the\npossibility of applying modern technical methods.\nThe end of the war and the resumption of normal\ncommercial relations between Russia and the outside\nworld, removing most of those handicaps, will pre\nsumably enable the Soviet Government to proceed\nwith tho socialization of agriculture on a larger scale.\nHoyne Seeing Red.\n(Continued from 1st page.)\n\"larence Darrow, Wm.

Class lines were drawn in two\neases. One gave as his reasons why he\ncould not serve as an unprejudiced\njuryman, because he was an employer\nof labor. A workingman frankly told\nthe prosecution that he would not con\nvict the defendants no matter what\nevidence the prosecution brought\nagainst them as a matter of principle.\nThe prosecution takes particular pains\nte wo that no striking switchmen or\nrailroaders get on the jury. One switch\nman examined stated that he had been\non the job for 30 years and denied he\nwas on trikc when challenged by the\nprosecution, stating that he was \"tak\ning a vacation.\"\nRadicals claim that the extreme per\nsecution carried on against radicals\nby the capitalist press for the past\nsix months is responsible for the dif\nficulty in securing a jury in these\noases. In the meantime, the defendants\namuse themselves by watching the\nplay of social forces in tho selection\nof the jury that will have in its\nkands the first test of the Illinois\nstate criminal syndicalism law and the\nbiggest legal case of the communists\nof the United States.\n0\nIDOL WORSHIP.\nA missionary from the United Stat\nes had spent many years among the\nheathen natives of East India. He had\nchristianized many of the natives. One\nef the great western virtues he was\nin the habit of teaching and empha\nsizing consisted of the statement that\nthe people of his native country did\nnot worship idols. He pointed out that\nhis countrymen were a great people\nwith a great nation.

This refers\nto the expulsion of \u201cAmbassador\u201d\nLudwig C. A. K. Martens, Soviet\nRussia\u2019s official representative in the\nUnited States, who with his family\nand staff has shaken the dust of this\ncountry from his feet, and departed\nfor Sweden, a more hospitable land\nto the Bolsheviki.\nThe wrath of the senators and rep\nresentatives and their indignation\nagainst the Wilson administration\nhas been caused, not so much be\ncause \u201cAmbassador\u201d Martens was\n\u201cfired\u201d out of the United States, but\nbecause almost simultaneously with\nhis departure from New York cable\ndispatches from London convened the\ninteresting information that the Brit\nish government was at that very mo\nment concluding reciprocal trade and\npolitical relations with the Soviet\nrepresentative in London, Leonid\nKrassin.\nMartens came here in 1916 as the\nrepresentative of a Russian steel\nfactory and was commissioner to rep\nresent the Soviet government in the\nUnited States in March, 1919. Since\nthat date he maintained an elaborate\noffice in New York, with a large\nstaff of employes and attaches, and\nmade tremendous efforts to get the\nUnited States to recognize the Lenin\nTrotzky regime, all of which ended\neventually in his deportation.\nIt is reported here that the British\nwere not entirely unpleased to have\nthe United States expel Martens\nfrom the United States, and that per\nhaps the Soviet envoy\u20193 departure\nwas hastened by British intrigue.\nAt any rate the British have profit\ned enormously by the expulsion of\nMartens from the United States, be\ncause when the Soviet envoy left\nour shores he announced that all\ncontracts for American products des\ntined for the Russian trade, made in\nthis country through his efforts,\namounting to many millions of dol\nlars, had been cancelled.\nThat is where the shoe pinches.\nBy Marten\u2019s departure American bus\niness men lose all the valuable con\ntracts for Russian trade, and this has\nleft considerable hostility in their\nminds against the Wilson policy re\ngarding Soviet Russia.\nBut the thing that stings worse\nthan the loss of the big Russian\ntrade contracts is the knowledge\nthat immediately after Marten was\nrun out of the United States the\nBritish recognized the Soviet gov\nernment through its envoy Krassin,\nin London. There is more than a sus\npicion in the minds of members of\ncongress that British diplomacy had\nsomething to do with the object in\nview of having the American trade\ncontracts cancelled, when those con\ntracts would of necessity fell to\nBritish firms.\nIt Is not the first time where\nGreat Britain has secretly fomented\nsuch schemes, and profited greatly\nthereby. Some congressmen say it\nis a clear case of London outwitting\nthe Wilson administration.\nIn the arrangement with Krassiti\nGreat Britain recognized the Soviet\ngovernment at Moscow. The princi\npal clauses of the agreement reached\nbetween the Bolsheviki agent and\nDowning street is of great import\nance to the British Empire. The first\nof these is that the Soviets agree not\nto propagandize against the British\nEmpire or possessions anywhere. In\nreturn the British will not oppose the\nSoviet government within its own\nboundaries and in any territory under\nits control. If this does not mean\nactual recognition of the Lenine\nTrotzky government, what would?\nThe British have lifted the block\nade against Russia. Soviet ships\nand Britishships are to be treated\nequally in the ports of both nations.\nThe agreement, and this is the sig\nnificant part of the whole matter,\nsays: \u2018\u2018Pending the conclusion of a\nformal general treaty between these\ntwo 'governments whereby their eco\nnomic and political relations shall be\nregulated in the future.\u201d\nThis must be a bitter pill for our\nstate department to swallow, on top\nof its action with our department of\nlabor, in deporting Martens.\nGermany is unable to carry on\nmuch trade with Russia now because\nthe Germany industries have not re\ncovered from the war. France will\nhave nothing to do with the Soviets.\nAs the United States has taken the\nsame attitude as France the only\nother nation that is equipped to carry\non trade with Russia\u2014Great Britain\n\u2014ihas stepped in and is in a fair way\nto secure at one stroke the whole\nimmense Muscovite import trade.\nEven if the Soviet government falls,\nto be succeeded by a real Russian re\npublic, the canny British merchants\nwill be on the ground and will un\ndoubtedly be in command of the Rus\nsian trade.\nVOICE OF THE ALASKA PRESS\nThere is one thing\u2014and perhaps\nonly one\u2014for which the editor of a\nnewspaper may always be thankful.\nThere is one time of the year when\nan editor\u2019s heart rejoices and his\nheart sings and the whole world\nlooks brighter. There is a season of\nthe year when the mocking birds\nwarble on the ridgepole of an edit\nors heart and he hums as he works\nand whistles as he walks, as he\nthinks what a lovely world this is,\nand that is when income tax time\ncomes. He never needs to worry\nabout that. AVhat he makes is al\nways less than the exemption. There\nis no such thing as an income tax in\nhis young life.\u2014Douglas Island News.\nTHINGS WE THINK\nThings Others Think and What We\nThink of the Things Others Think.\nIt is odd that we should punish the\nslayer by slaying.\nArmy red tape seems to be about\nthe longest thing extant.\nAn optimist is a man who imagines\nhe can feel a kick in hard cider.\nFor your health eat more onions;\nfor your social standing let \u2019em alone.\nWith Japan watching Yankee resi\ndents, we have another case of the\npot calling the kettle black.\nThe way they dress now has con\nvinced the average observer of the\nfact that ankles are born and not\nmade.\nJess Willard says that pride and\nnot poverty makes him want to fight\nDempsey again.

He declared\nthe Soviet Govt had no right to dictate\nto Poland what sort of Govt. the Poles\nshould have. The Premier asserted that\nan independent Poland was essential to\nthe whole fabric of peace and the Allies\nwere resolved that they must arrest the\ndestruction of Poland and the march of\nthe Bolshevik armies through VPolish\nterritory. If the Bolshevists overran\nPoland, they would be up against the\nGerman frontier and Mr. Lloyd George\nsaid, this would furrnish Germany a great\ntemptatior with her million of trained\nmen. It would be a cheap way, accord\ning to the Premier for Germany\nso get out of her obligations. \u2018']\nonly ask the members, to think wheth\ner it might yet have the effect of\ndepriving the Allies of the fruits of a\ndearly bought victory\u2019\u2019. He pointed out\nthat the Soviet Govt. had not been chos\nen by the Russian seople and he deciared\nthat it was as great an autocracy as its\npredecessor.

Was\nthe Russian Soviet organized as a\nmeans of class domination. What has\nbeen the spirit behind its establish\nment in Germany. Does it still hold\nthe confidence of the Russian masses.\nDr. Samuel N. Harper, Assistant Pro\nfessor of Russian Language and In\nstiutions in ttie University of Chic\ncigo. wh-_ i-.as been making a special\n| s.l. :; jf Russia since 1904, and was\nthere during the ea.ly months of the\nrevolution and has kept in constant\ntouch with Russian affairs since his\nreturne, was asked these questions two\n; days ago. This matter o fthe Soviet\nis very important, he declares, for\n\u25a0 toisnevism in ttussia nas fallen in\nwhat has been from the beginning its\nI ostensible object\u2014tic betterment of\njifa and circumstance for the work\nman and peasant. Woven in with its\n'.failure, as not the least of Its crimes,\nis what it has done to the idea of the\nSoviet in Russia. With that is nedes\nsarily connected the status and prin\nI ciple of the Soviet in Germany.\nBig Change In Russia\n\u2018\u2022The Soviet in Russia has passed\nthrough a decided change since its in\nception of the early days of the revo\nlution.\u201d Professor Harper said. \u201cIt\nwas originally democratic, co-opera\ntive. It has been perverted from its\noriginal function by the efforts of this\nsmall and energetic group, the Bol\nsneviki, wno nave cnangea it froi..\nan agent of national co-operation to\nsomething to be used by them as ar\ninstrument in their class war. It i!\nevident that it is now discredited bj\nthe workment themselves. But ii\nGermany, I should judge that the So\n. viet had been Bolshevist in spirit\nfrom the beginning. So far as one can\nj tell, it appears that the Soviet there\nhjs been started at the point to which\n\u25a0 *lie Bolshevist have brought it in Rus\nI sia\u2014the point, that is, not of co-cp\neration, but of class antagonism and\ni class rule.\n\"Authoritative judgment or xne\ni Dresent condition in Germany I do not\nj feel qualified to express; I do not\nI think that any one here can speak au\ni \u2018horitatively of such a hit-or-miss sit\n\u2022 nation as that appears to be, with such\n; quickly changing and contradictory\nj news. Cut from the reports that\nj reach us it seems evident that the So\nviet in Germany is very like what the\nFolsheviki have made of it in Russia\n\u2014and therefore very different from\nthe original Russian idea of the So\nviet.\n! \"| believe that in Germany the\nspirit of the Soviets has always been\nBolshevist. I can see no signs that the\nj German Soviet has ever expresstd the\ni original Russian idea. The German\nSpartacans have been opposed all a\n; long to the calling of a Constituent\nAssembly. Where the Russian Bol\nsheviki first urged and then opposed\n: the Constituent Assembly, the Ger\n; man Spartacans have consistently\nfought the assembly idea and called\n| for the dictatorship of the proletariat,\nj We must remember that conditions in\nregard to an election in Germany are\ni very different from those that obtain\ned in Russia. Because the German peo\nrle had had so much more political\nlife, it was possible to hold a Constit\n\u25a0 ent Assembly a few months after\nthe revolution. In Russia such im\nmediate action was impossible. Elect\nion lists nad to be got ready and\nouier elementary preparations made,\ni \"In those early days in Russia the\ni ropearance cf the Soviet was some\nj v/hat to be heartily welcomed by the\nProvisional Government. Now, just\n! what was that Soviet idea! What did\nit promise.\n\"The original, the real Soviet prin\ndole represented the direct participa\ntion of the peasants, workmen, and\nsoldiers in public life for the deter\nmination cf the new order for the\ncountry. In it the first provisional gov\ntrnment recognizes an organization 01\npeasants, workmen and soldiers tha1\nwould bring the more democratic ele\nments throughout the country intc\nthe task of reorganizing the nation a!\nernment recognizes an organization ol\nrnd make certain their interest anc\nco-operation.\n\"One member of the provisional gov\nt9r the revolution, and would arouse\nworried about the success of the re\nUition until the Soviet emerged; h<\ndid net fee! sure that the new govern\ncould get the cyj-operation of the\nworkmen, peasants and soldiers anc\nwhen the Soviets were first formed he\nf;!t that here was the assurance o1\ncooperation that would make the revc\nlution truly national.. That was whai\nthe men who assumed the government\nwhen the revolution came wanted it\n| to be of course Also, the revolution\nj was not purely political, it was a mass\n| awakening, the protest of the mass of\nRussia. In the Soviets, as this member\nof the government explained to me. he\nsaw the channels through which the\nmasses of the people would express\nj themselves and organize.\n. \"It must be remembered, moreover,\nthat the Soviets like the provisional\ngovernment itself, were not intended\ni to function politically after the elect\nj ion of the Constituent Assembly. A\n\u25a0 good many poople felt that after the\nnew democratic National Govern\nment\u2014tne permanent Government\u2014\n* had been formed, the Soviets might\nj continue as economic bodies, such as\nthe trade unions, or as economic or\nganizations with political significance,\ni as a Peasant Party or Labor Party.\nBut the original Soviet idea was not\none of permanent political organiza\ntion or power\u2014most emphatically not\nof the sole power, exercising a dic\ntatorship.\n\"In the beginning, therefore, the\nScviet was not Bolshevist in spirit\u2014\nthat is, it did not represent class war.\nIn the beginning it was in itself an\nexpression of the co-operation of all\nclasses toward a common objective\u2014\nwhich is the very antithesis cf the\nBolshevist idea.\nClass reeling Arousea\n\u201cEut very soon after the first revo\nlution, the small, energetic minority\n(Troon of the Bolsheviki set to work\ndeliberately and consistently to stir\nup class feeling in the Soviet, and\nthrough the Soviet in the mass of the\nRussian people. They set to work to\nfight co-operation, to institute what\nthey called a social revolution\u2014that\nl is to say, a class struggle. It took\nthem nine months 'of the most ener\ngetic and unscrupulous propaganda to\ndo this. By unscrupulous I mean to\nsay that they very subtly mis repre\nsented the aim of the Provisional Gov\nernment. They also took advantage of\nthe acute economic distress, and made\nimaginative promises to the people. By\nstirring up class antagonism they de\nfeated the efforts of the Provisional\nGovernment to solve the ceonomic pro\nblems with which it was faced.\n\u2018\u2022The Bolsheviki now insist that\nthey were responding simply to the ex\n| isting sentiment in the masses of the\noeople. that they were not stirring up\n. feeling, but simply meeting it. That\nhas been the alibi they have used.\nThe answer to that is easilly found in\na study cf the Bolshevist speeches in\nthe Soviets, their articles in the\nnewspapers, and the literature that\nthey pread all over the country, es\noecially among the soldiers. There is\nno question that the Soviet idea had\n\u201creat influence, an there is no ques\ntion that the Bolsheviki perverted it.\nThere are people, I new, who think\nthat the Soviet was Bolshevist in\nsoirit from the beginning, but I do not\nconsider that that was the case.\n\u201cThose of us who were following\nthe revolution as students felt that the\nSoviet idea was perhaps its biggest\nContinued on Page 4.\nREGISTRATION NOTICE\nTo accommodate those for whom it\nis inconvenient to register in the day\ntime the registration will be open ev\nery night this week from 7 o\u2019clock to\n. 9 o\u2019clock except Saturday when it\n; will close at 4 o\u2019clock p. m.\nS.

Correspondence Bureau.)\nOne of the youngest of small\nstates which came into being dur\ning the last two years and estab\nlished itself upon the ruins of\nRussia and Germany, is the Re\npublic of Latvia. Her neighbors\nin the south and north now known\nas Esthonia and Lithuania were\nboth originally founded by the\nGermans themselves during their\nperiod of occupation, with the ob\nject of weakening Great Russia\nand depriving that Empire of ex\ncess to the Baltic Sea. Such \\v\u00a3^s\nnot the case with the preserft\nLatvia which is composed of w}.at\nwere previously the provinces of\nKurland and Lifland. These\nprovinces possess in addition to\ntheir well-developed commerce in\nexport through their great\nof Riga and Libau, & richly cul\ntivated soil and Germany v as\nsorely tempted to annex tl^se\nprovinces to her own empire. This\nseemed particularly desirable *nd\neasy when the Baltic Gerr&an\nland owners who were for genera\ntions the chief owners of ,ne\ncountry, invited Kaiser Wilhelm\nto convert their territory intu a\nPrussian province and creafo a\nthrone for one of his sons, \"rrue\nenough, the Letts who composed\nno less than eighty per cent of\nthe population vehemently pro\ntested against the suggestion but\nBerlin was little concerned with\ntheir sentiment and was already\npreparing a crown for Joachim,\nthe Kaiser's youngest son. Ger\nmany's defeat followed by the\nBerlin revolution of November 9,\n1918, completely upset this ar\nrangement and only a few days\nlater, on November 18th, the Lat\nvian population declared itself an\nindependent state, elected a- pro\u00ad\nJournal of Modern Jewish Life and Labors\nVOL.

At that period\nthere were still about thirty thou\nsand German soldiers who were\ncontrolling the territory but\nthanks to the soldiers' councils\nwhich the revolution was estab\nlishing in all occupied territories,\nthe German forces found them\nselves compelled to hand over all\ngovernment institutions. As a\nmatter of fact the assertion and\nestablishment of a new state\nproved no easy matter and took\nalmost a year in time and many\nthousands of human victims\nwhich had to be sacrificed in or\nder to rid the territory of all Gei\nman interference.\nIt was still while the Letts were\nfighting the Germans for control\nthat the Bolsheviki came along,\nremoved the Letvian government\nwho were composed mainly of\nwealthy elements and moderate\nSocialists, instituted a Soviet gov\nernment, made up of local Letts\nof the most undesirable types and\nthose Letts who were represented\nin the Left Wing of the Soviet\ngovernment. The new govern\nment which existed for about five\nmonths, did a great amount of\nharm and left the country in a\nstate of complete ruin. The Ger\nman land owners particularly suf\nfered. They had for years j?een\nenslaving and oppressing the\ngreat Lett masses and these lat\nter did not hesitate to revenge\nthemselves in a most brutal fash\nion while they had the opportu\nnity. Hundreds and hundreds of\nwealthy and aristocratic families\nwere completely wiped out, and\ntheir property was confiscated.\nTo all intents and purposes the\n\\%jgrws*f\"\n.r-%\n7\n\"-vL\" MM A 4MB\n%\u00ab^o 73\nUOs'i^\nW '\\J\n1\n\"^v -~v\nfeudal society of these provinces\nwas completely unrooted. Wittt\nthe aid of English ammunition\nand hired German forces, the Bolj^\nsheviks were finally driven out\nbut the new government with Ut\u00bb\nman as Premier, which the Eng\nlish set up, did not last. It was\nunseated by the Germans and was\nfollowed by an internal war be\ntween the Letts and these Ger\nman forces which lasted many\nmonths. It was not until last\nMay that Ulman's government\nfinally succeeded in calling the\nfirst Constitutional Assembly and\nestablishing order in the new\nstate.\nNo definite peace has as yet\nbeen concluded betweeri Latvia\nand the Soviet government (since\nthis article was written, cables\nhave announced that Latvia has\nsigned a peace agreement with\nthe Soviet government) although\nnegotiations have been under way\nnow for over half a year. This\nfact is chiefly due to England's\ninfluence which is very desirous\nof having this new state which\nhas an abundance of new mate\nrial such as wood, flax, etc., re\nmain more or less dependent up\non its help and guidance. Never\ntheless, the Russian Soviet, true\nto its principle, voluntarily hand\ned over to Latvia, the districts of\nDwinak, Reshisza and Lutzin, all\nof the province of Witebesk, be\ncause this territory is chiefly pop\nulated by Letts and is historically\nknown as \"Letgalim/'\nUnited Latvia composed of the\none-time provinces of.

When the Bolshevlkl got\ncontrol of the Soviet they eliminated\nidea cf co-operation, entirely and sub\nstituted for It the idea of domlna\n*irn through class war. The simple\ncatchphrase of the Bolsheviki was \u2018All'\nthe power to the Soviets!\u2019\n\"The perversion by the Bolsheviki\nof the Soviet is perhaps one of the\ngreatest of the Bolshevist crimes.\n\"The great question at the present\ntime, from our point of view, is\nwnetner tne soviet still makes a\nstrong appeal to the Russian workmen\nand peasants, or is discredited because\nof the use the Bolsheviki have made\nof it. What is the actual attitude now\nof the Petrograd workingman, for ex\nample, toward the Soviet.\n\u201cThe reports that we get front men\nwho have been there recently\u2014not the\nmen who were there in the early\nmonths of the Bolshevist power, but\nmen who were .there..last Summer and\nin the Autumn\u2014are-to the .effect that\nthe Soviet idea is now discredited. .1\npersonally, on the basis of reports\nfrom sources which I could not Ignore\ncame around last July to the idea that\nthe Soviet was being discredited in\nthe minds of the peasants, and even\n\u2018he workmen.\u201d\n\u201cIt is this idea, already discredited\namong the masses of the Russian peo\nple, which, as Dr. Harper points out.\nappears to be animating the work\nmen's and peasants' organizations in\nGermany. And it is in the perversion;\nof the Soviet principle, he adds, that\nthe Bolsheviki have both denied the\nefficacy of the democratic ideal, and <\nfailed in what, the world was given to\nunderstand, was their aim from the\nbreaming.\n\"The Bolsheviki have failed,\u201d he\nsaid \"Many people in this country are\nsoft-hearted about them because it is\nsaid that \u2018they are helping the work\ningman.' Put They have failed, ac\ncording to everything that I can find\nout through the most careful study\nand cross-examination, not at all be\ncause they have not been able to elim-!\ninate the bourgeosie. but because they\nhave not bettered the conditions of\nthe workmen and peasants. I belong\nmyself to what they would call the\nbourgeosie, and I feel personally very\nsorry for the bourgeosie. But the\ngreat failure of the Bolsheviki is not'\nconcerned with the bourgeoisie: it is\nconcerned with the masses.\nDenied Our Ideals\n\"In denying and discrediting the So\nviet idea they have denied completely\nwhat is our ideal\u2014the ideal cf ro-op\neration. We believe that the different\nclasses can work together, that actual\nco-operation is possible and practic\nable. That is the end toward which\nwe work. The Bolshevik denies this\nas a \u2018bourgeois dream.\u2019 He insists on\nclass hatred, class war, class rule\u2014\nwmcn is precisely what the Gzar s\nautocracy did before him.\n\"We do not know now whether or\nnot the discrediting of the Soviet is\nonly temporary. I myself believe that,\nwhile the word Soviet may be dropped\nhe idea of co-operation is so firmly\ningrained in the Russian mind that it\nwill prevail in the new Russia. That\nthere will be a new Russia, I have no\ndoubt. We cannot tell when it may\nemerge. It is a matter of time. But\nI feel sure that there is no danger\neither that the old autocratic order\nwill be restored or that the Bolshe\nvist system of class war will endure.\u201d\nSeats for Under the Stars and\nStiipes now on sale at Ryus Drug\nStore. \u2014Adv. 2t.\nRESTAURANT\nCHANGES HANDS\nCharles Sing, who has purchased the\nLiberty Luuneh on Front St. from Mrs.\nTina Retsch last Saturday, plans to\n| renovate and make the place one of\nthe best cafes in town and will an\nnounce the opening date just a3 soon\nas everything is In readiness.

(One pood equals 36.11\npounds avoirdupois.)\nEighty versts south of the town of Kuznetsky\n(so continues Lenine's book), is the\nTolbesk iron ore. If this region were connected\nwith the Kuznetsk station by a railway\nan iron factory could easily turn out\nfrom fr?rtv trt flffv millinn nnnrt r?f iron\na year.\nAt a distance of one hundred versts from\nthe Irtysh is the Ekibas coal mine with\nthirty-five milliard pood of coal. This properly\nalready belongs to an English company,\nhowever, the Irtysh Trading Corporation of\nLondon, if I mistake not. A year ago nil\nthe English employees of that company fle<l\nbefore the Red army, and one of them who\nwas captured was not allowed to return to\nEkibas. And even if he had returned he <\ncould have done his employers no good service,\nfor all labor in the Ekibas mines had\nbecome demoralized.\nIn southeastern Russia there will be concessions\nwith an area of 3,077.123 dessiatlna\nof land open to foreign concessionaires who\nwish to engage in agriculture and the raising\nof cattle. They must work with the most up\nto date machinery, and the question of transporting\ntheir agricultural produce abroad\nwill be arranged by mutual agreement\nRussian Newspaper Comments\nOn the Vanderlip Concession\nSpeaking of the Vanderlip concession In\nKamchatka, the Pravdn says:\n\"The question of concessions ought to be\nconsidered from the standpoint of the energetic\nstruggle between socialism and capitalism.\nThe economic condition of the country\nis catastrophic. To reestablish trade and\ncommerce in the republic with our own\nStrength and while the fl^ht was at lt? hit\nforest would have boon difficult. It would\nbe difficult even now, and It la absolutely necessary\nthat we have a breathing apace during\nwhich we can make use for a time of\nall-embracing capital. In this way we shall\nstrengthen ourselves for the conflict.\n\"At the present moment Kamchatka Is\nquite outside the sphere of our Influence\nand has for us no value whatsoever. No\nmatter how strong may be our desire to do\nso we arc physically Incapable of making\nthe slightest exertion for the exploitation of\nKamchatka's natural resources.\"\nI asked an extremely well Informed Lettish\nofficial what he thought of the present\nIntensive propaganda of the Bolsheviks on\nthe subject of concessions, and If he believed\nthat Lcnlne could possibly guarantee any\nprofits at all to foreign capitalists. My Lettish\nfriend said that nearly 90 per cent, of\nthe propaganda was Insincere and untrue,\nbut that, nevertheless. It was possible for\nLenine to make the Ituss'an muxhlk act as\n1 slave to the foreign concessionaire.\n\"Al present,\" he said, \"Russian labor slm\n;UNDAY, JANUARY 30, 1<\nis to Du]\nssian Workers to^ State\nj of Luring Foreign\nRed Chiefs Fear\nps on Lettish,\nice Talk\nply does as It Is told.

Stranger things have happened.\"\nRed Chiefs, Afraid of Own Armies,\nWould Grasp Excuse to Disarm Them\nThe same authority went on to explain\nto me that the Bolsheviks are really anxious\nfor foreign capitalists to come In so that they\ncan turn part of the Red army into a labor\narmv to work for lhnso fnnfmslnnniroa Thn\nRed chiefs are really afraid of their own\narmy, hence they are keeping t at present on\nthe frontier, as far from Moscow as possible,\nbut in places where It will be better fed than\nIt will be In the capital. If, say, an English\ncapitalist takes a great forest concession on\nthe northern coast of European Russia\n( Trotzky will only be too delighted at this\nopportunity of disarming a battalion of his\nRed army and sending them to work for a\nforeigner who will feed and clothe them\nand in this way keep them quiet.\nAnd Trotzky seems to have no fear that\nsuch a Mr elgner will ever turn out to be i\nreactionary. Between the cosmopolitan Bolshevik\nand a certain type of cosmopolitan\ncapitalist there Is at present much In common;\nand in future these two may also have\nin common a strong aversion to seeing the\nCzar back or to allowing any kind of parliamentary\ngovernment to be established In\nRussia.\nMy Lettish friend threw out these latter\nsuggestions for what they were worth, but\nwas quite sure that the key to the Bolshevik\npolicy of the last year Is to be found in\nLonlnc's desire to keep the Red army always\nemployed and fed. A year ago It was thrown\nat Siberia, then It was hifrled at the Poles,\nthen It was sent tn th?

Thus the Communists,\nwho hated the capitalists above all things\nand regarded priests and kings as mere\ntools of capital, are now about to shake\nhands with this deadly enemy over the bound\nand helpless body of Russian labor.\nThe Hovlet Congress now sitting under the\nITesldeney of I,enlne at Moscow Is making\na desperate effort to prove that Bolshevism\nis profoundly,peaceful and principally Inter\nm. ?\npe Conces\n^ ^ ^\nA H - A\n1 > A\n< > * J v\nI * . \\ -,r\nI- ? *\"*\nLATVIA'S PR1\n---'s & *<\n- ,,'v V \" v\n\"\np .\nTROTZKY.\nested in giving away valuable concessions to\nforeigners.\nOn December 27 Comrade Miiyutin held\nforth for a long time to the foreign correspondents\non the subject of concessions.

In such concessions as\nthat both sides stand to gain. Soviet Russia\ngives the concession In the hope that, as a\nresult of It, closer commercial relations will\nbe established with Europe which, without\nour raw material and our food products, can\nnever hope to surmount tne colossal economic\ndifficulties which lie in its path.\"\nApropos of this, I learn from a Russian\nrecently arrived here from Archangel, that\nIf any English firm intends to buy wood or 1\nhides in northern Russia they must bring\nwith them not only their own ships but also 1\ntheir own labor for getting the goods aboard 1\nas the Russian laboring population ashore 1\narc literally too weak to load a vessel.

But at the same time we wou\"..l\nask those who take concessions from us to\nbe perfectly loyal In their relations with us\ntnd to he faithful to their obligations.\"\nThe Bolsheviks are displaying great diplomatic\nskill In getting the capitalists to compete\nwith one another by telling the French\nthat the English are getting hold of all the\nbig contusions and by whispering to the\nEnglish that the Americans are collaring\neverything.\nI had an opportunity of ascertaining the\nBolshevik point of view on the condition of\naffairs In Latvia.

Radzinsh, who recently\npublished an alarmist article about the Reds\ncn the Latvian frontier, was a Pole, and they\nreplied that, though he was a Lett, he was\nunder Polish influence. This Lettish General\nhad presupposed that some of the Red Letts\nIn the Bolshevik army on the Livonlan\nfrontier took it into their heads to invade\nLettland and, curiously enough, some Red\nLetts did cross the frontier the next day,\nDecember 24, and plunder several villages.\nThe Bolsheviks state that their number was\nforty, but the report In Riga Is that It was\n4,000. Nothing has been published on this\nsubject in Lettland and the whole affair is\nbeing kept very quiet.\nThe Poles also complain that Red soldiers\ncrossed the Polish frontier and plundered\nPolish villages, but this the Reds deny.\nThey say that possibly some robber bands,\nhard pressed by the Soviet forces, may have\ngone into Poland. However that may be, a\nfeeling of unrest certainly does exist even\nhere in Latvia, where there Is no reason for\nit and, in order to dissipate it, the Latvian\nForeigm Minister has Just given to the official\ntelegraph agency a rather too optimistic\nsurvey of the situation. In which he denies\nthat the Soviet troops are concentrated in\nany considerable numbers on the Lettish,\nLithuanian or Polish frontiers.\nStirring Up Unrest in One Place\nWhile Allaying It in Another\nA curious feature of the general unrest is\nthat while the Red representatives are stirring\nit up in one place they are allaying it ,\nin another. In Kovno the Russian newspaper\nEcho, which is the mouthpiece of Axelrode.\nthe local Bolshevik Minister, is constantly\nfilled with alarmist reports about Red\nconcentrations on every Western frontier,\nfrom Rumania to Finland, and the Poles, on\nthe other hand, make light of all this. In\nLatvia 1 he Poles and the French are accused\nof spreading alarmist rumors while the\nBolsheviks are posing as injured innocents\nwhose sole desire Is peace. The explanation\nprobably is that all this part of the world\nis more or less in a state of chaos, and that\nthe Bolshevik \"diplomatists\" In particular\nhave no fixed policy.\nIn his opening address before the All-Russian\nSoviet Congress in Moscow Lenin*\nspoke as follows:\n\"As we shall soon have s'gned peace with\nthe Poles we must now turn our attention\nto reconstructive work Inside Russia.

That's what all militarists say. ?\nThat's what the Germans said when j\nthey invaded Belgium.\"\nOpposition Is Surprising\nIn general there was a surprising j\namount of opposition from fhe radi- I\ncals tc Bolshevism and its methods in j\nRussia.\nMrs. Strunsky quoted Karl Kautsky,\nleader ?f the Independent German So?\ncialists, as condemning the Bolsheviki\nfor their counter revolutionary meth?\nods, and as stating that the Bolsheviki\nhave discredited socialism. She also\nquoted a number of prominent Euro- ;\npean and Russian Socialists as opposed\nto the Bolsheviki.\nA discussion of the societ form and\nthe guild, form of Socialism followed.\nThe merits of the Right and Left\nwings of the Socialist party of Amer\nica were discussed, and most of the\nspeakers opposed the Left vVing.\nNeighborhood Houses\nDeny All Bolshevism\nThe United Neighborhood Houses,\nboth through their counsel, Harold\nRiege?man, and Miss Mary Kingsbury\nSirnkhovitch, speaking for the execu?\ntive committee, yesterday lodged with\nSenator Clayton R. Lusk. chairman of\nthe joint legislative comm'ttee in?\nvestigating seditious activities, a pro?\ntest against insinuations, direct or im?\nplied, that the settlement houses are\ntainted with Bolshevism. Both Mr.\nRiegelman and Miss Sirnkhovitch say\nthe very opposite is true?that the con?\nduct of the houses inculcates the high?\nest ideals and the purest Americanism.\nMiss Sirnkhovitch in her statement\nsaid:\nr \"The community houses of New\nYork, or settlements, as they are some?\ntimes called, are federated in an or?\nganization called the United Neighbor?\nhood Houses of New York. In these\nhouses American traditions, ideals and\nmodes of life are taught in a practical\nway every day.\n\"These houses have been and are\nthe strongholds of genuine American?\nism in the foreign quarters of our city.\nThey are supported and indorsed by\nsuch people as Henry P.

The Hungarian situation will be the first pro\nposition to come before the meeting. It is more than likely\nthat the Polish question will be discussed also.\nCONFERENCE HEED ON HUNGARIAN SITUATION\nPARIS, March 24.\u2014(/P)\u2014The Echo de Paris in its is\nsue this morning states that Premier Clenienceau and For\neign Minister Pichon held a lengthy conference this morn\ning regarding the Hungarian situation. Just what transpired!\nat the meeting is not made public but it is thot some move\nof importance will be made within a short time.\nHUNGARIAN SITUATION CRITICAL\nPARIS, March 24.\u2014(j*P)\u2014The Hungarian question wasj\ntaken under consideration upon the advice of the entente\nagents, who state that the situation in Hungary has become\nextremely critical. It is reported that street fighting has;\nalready broken out in Budapest, the soviet troops practically\nbeing in control of the city.\nPOLISH QUESTION NEAR SETTLEMENT\nPARIS, March 24.\u2014(/P)\u2014The war council which had\nunder discussion the Polish question stated today that it\nhad nearly settled that question. It was decided that the\nPolish division in France would be returned home by the\nway of Koenigsberg instead of by Danzig to prevent a clash\nwith the Germans, who are at the present time hostile ow\ning to the granting of the use of Danzig to the Poles as a\nMJCipUi l.\nLEAGUE OF NATIONS COMMISSION TO MEET\nPARIS, March 24.\u2014(/P)\u2014Following the meeting rela\ntive to the Hungarian and Polish questions the league of\nnations commission will hold a meeting to conclude the draft\nof the league. It is expected that this meeting will last well\ninto the night and the members have made their arrange\nments accordingly. While it is not a certainty that the\ndra ft will be finished at the meeting tonight it is almost a\ncertainty that it will be in such shape that but little work\nwill be required before it is presented for consideration and\nadoption.\nGERMANY WILL OPPOSE DANZIG AWARD\nPARIS, March 24.\u2014(/P)\u2014It is understood that the\npeace conference intends to grant Poland the right to use the\nport of Danzig on the Baltic as an outlet for its foreign\ntrade. Poland has no seaport and has petitioned the peace\nconference that it be given the right to pass over German;\nterritory to the Baltic in order to market its goods. The,\npeace conference is going to grant the petition whether j\nGermany likes the situation or not and will use force to\ncompel Germany to permit the use of Danzig. Despatches'\nreceived here from agents in Germany state that Germany i\nwill oppose any movement of the Poles toward Danzig, re- j\nsorting to arms if necessary.\nBARRIER AGAINST BOLSHEVISM\nSUMMARY.\u2014The question of the barrier which the;\npeace conference intends to erect against the spread of Bol-!\nshevism into the Teutonic countries has come sharply to the\nfront as the result of the situation in Hungary. The Bol\nsheviki elements have seized the power in Hungary and de\nclares that a state of war exists between Hungary and the\nentente. According to the Paris newspapers the peace con\nference may take military action against the movement.\nThe newspapers state that the situation is a serious one and\nurges that military action be taken. Many believe that Ger\nmany is behind the movement for the purpose of retarding\nthe peace work, believing that if sufficient delay is caused\nthe work of the peace conference will be'defeated. London\nthinks that the trouble has been partly caused by the delay in j\ncompleting the treaty of peace.\nPARIS NEWSPAPERS STATE THAT\nSLOW METHODS OF CONFERENCE\nCAUSED BOLSHEVISM IN HUNGARY\nLONDON, March 25.\u2014(/P)\u2014Due to the alarming\nsituation in Hungary nearly all of the newspapers in this\ncity are dealing with the circumstance without restraint.\nPa^es of editorials have been devoted to the alarming rate\nwith which Bolshevism has been spreading thruout Europe\nand the present invasion into Hungary has called forth a\nstorm of protest from all the papers of the city on the slow\nmethods of the peace conference. Ever since last Novem\nber the conference has been dragging along and what at\nfirst was thot would take only about six weeks to accom\nplish has required nearly that many months and nothing\ndefinite accomplished yet.\nCHASIGN WILL O\u2019 THE WISP.\nMany of the publications are of the opinion that Bol\nshevism would never have gained a foothold in Hungary had\nquick action been the rule of the peace conference instead\nof so many side issues. They believe that the people of\nHungary became dissatisfied with the prevailing conditions\nand embraced Bolshevism as a means of relieving an al\nready strained situation. The peace conference instead of\nactually settling down to business have been wasting their\ntime in chasing a will o\u2019 the wisp\u2014the league of nations.\nHad the peace conference held its sessions for the purpose\nfor which it was originally organized it is highly probable\nthat the peace treaty would have been either signed or re\njected.\nJUGO-SLAVS PESSIMISTIC\nPARIS, March 25.\u2014(/P)\u2014The Jugo-Slav delegation to\nthe peace conference have taken a pessimistic view of the\nsituation between their country and Poland and Rumania.\nOwing to the close relationship that exists between the three\ncountries the Poles are afraid Bolshevism will spread to\nthe two latter countries should the revolution in Hungary as\nsume large proportions.\nLEAGUE OF NATIONS UNDER CONSIDERATION\nPARIS, March 25.\u2014(/P)\u2014The league of nations com\nmission has considered many of the proposed amendments\nto the league of nations covenant and have tentatively dis\nposed of the first sixteen sections, which have been agreed\nupon. Several changes have been made in the form of the\ncovenant and it is believed that when it is presented for\ndiscussion at the peace conference, fully fifty per cent of\nthe objections presented by Senator Lodge and other mem\nbers of the United States senate will be overcome. Presi\ndent Wilson attended the meeting of the commission and\nwas an attentive listener to all the proceedings. While sev\neral matters were discussed pertaining to the league and\nthe provisions of the amendments no action was taken on the\namendments which were inserted for the safeguarding of\nthe Monroe Doctrine. This matter will be taken up tomor\nrow and the full time of the commission be devoted to that\ndiscussion alone.\nCOMMISSIONS AWAIT INSTRUCTIONS\nPARIS, March 25.\u2014(/P)\u2014Nearly all of the commis\nsions and sub-commissions of the peace conference are\nwaiting for the council\u2019s instructions to be issued ordering\nthem to close their investigations and submit their reports.\nThis is taken as an indication that matters on peace lines\nwill come to a head soon.\nAMERICAN AMENDMENT ADOPTED\nPARIS, March 25.\u2014(/P)\u2014The league of nations com\nmission reports that it has adopted the amendment submit\nted by the American delegation which provides protection\nto the nations comprising the league against an influx of\nforeign labor. The commission affirms the right of any\ncountry to control matters solely within its domestic juris\ndiction.\nLEAGUE\u2019S POWER LIMITED\nAnother amendment affecting the reduction of arma\nments limits the powers of the league\u2019s executive council\nto a simple recommendation to the government affected.\nProvisions were also made for the revising from time to\ntime fo the league\u2019s covenant. This will meet all objections\nmade regarding the inflexibility of the constitution of the\nleague.\nHUNGARY UNDER\nSOVIET CONTROL\nMAY HAVE WAR\nWASHINGTON, March 24.\u2014(/P)\u2014A despatch to the\nstate department from Belgrade states that the new Hun\ngarian government has ordered a resumption of hostilities\nagainst the entente.

All of the theatres and music\nhalls have been taken over by the new government and noth\ning but plays of a revolutionary order are allowed. These\nplays have been especially written foy the soviet and are\ninflammable in parts. The public attending the productions\nare beginning to feel the. influence of, the plays arid it is\nbelieved that before long the entire population will become\npart of the Soviet following.\nMAY HAVE EXTENDED INTO GERMANY.\nCOPENHAGEN, March 24.\u2014(/PJ\u2014It is reported that\ncoincident with the forming of a new Hungarian govern\nment fresh Spartacan outbreaks in Berlin have occurred.\nThis is taken to indicate that the movement was intended to\nbecome general from Budapest to Berlin. Owing to Aus\ntria\u2019s refusal to join in the movement a break has occurred\nin the line of communication which will be detrimental to\nthe rapid advance of Soviet propaganda.\nAUSTRIA WILL NOT JOIN.\nAMSTERDAM, March 24.\u2014(/P)\u2014Despatches from\nAustria state that overtures have been made to that gov\nernment by the new government of Hungary to join them\nin their movement for a general Soviet republic. Austria\nhas declined the offer, preferring her present situation to\none of uncertainty. Moreover, Austria is depending upon\nthe allies for her food supply and once she joins the Hun\ngarian Soviet government that source of succor will be shut\noff and her condition become worse. The people are ap\nparently satisfied with their present circumstances and would\nprobably resist any intrusion.\n\u00ab * **\n'SOVIET CLAIMS TO POWER ARE !\nPREMATURE; HUNGARY HAS NOT\nFULLY EMBRACED BOLSHEVISM'\n- j\nCOPENHAGEN, March 25.\u2014(/P)\u2014A Vienna despatch i\nstates that the Hungarian Soviet\u2019s claim to power is slight\nly premature as the entire people of the country have not!\nyet declared themselves in favor of its adoption. The state-]\nment given out that the entire Hungarian people had tie-;\ndared for a soviet government is declared to be untrue. At\nthe present time a state of panic exists in many portions of\nHungary, the people believing that a reign of terror is\nabout to be inaugurated along the same lines as that con\nducted in Russia.\nSOCIALIST PARTY MAY SUPPORT MOVE\nVIENNA, March 25.\u2014(/P)\u2014From present indications\njit is believed that the entire socialist party of Hungary will|\n] support the newly declared soviet form of government. Their!\njaction will not be based so much upon their love for the new\nform of government as much as their feelings toward thoj\nentente, for which they express a deep hatred. All of this1\nfaction without reserve are strongly against those coun\ntries which humiliated Hungary. Most of the rural popu\nlation are reported as being in favor of the soviet and have 1\ntaken sides with them against former associates who Mill ]\npledge their allegiance to the former government.\nDISARM FRENCH IN BUDAPEST\nPARIS, March 25.\u2014(/P)\u2014The allied mission which d\n] have been at Budapest for the past two days and who were1,\nconsidering leaving that city reported to the supreme conn- \u2022\ncil that they had been informed that permission would he ]\ndenied them to take their departure, being considered as ,\ninterned owing to the declaration of war of the soviet\ngovernment upon the entente.

Former premier Dr. 1\nAlexander Wekerle has been placed under arrest owing to\nhis outspoken opinions on the present state of affairs. The\ndoctor is much opposed to the present high handed pro- ,\nceedings and has no hesitancy in stating so.

JULY 7, 1919\nTHE SOVIET FICTION\nThe political dilettanti have evolved\na delightfully simple theory of the\nregime at Moscow. It runs something\nlike this: The soviets constitute a\nform of democratic government de\nrived from peasant institutions, in\nharmony with Russian political ge\nnius, and directly responsive to popu\nlar will. The Bolsheviki are a politi\ncal party that has got control of the\nsoviet machinery of government. They\nare extremists, honest to be sure, but\nattempting an impracticable economic\nprogram. They may be displaced in\nthe soviets by some other party, or\nthey may adapt their program to the\ndemands of economic fact. Indeed,\ntheir American apologists would have\nus believe that they are now follow\ning the latter course and have so far\nabandoned their intransigeant atti\ntude that it is possible for other peo\nples to have relations with them. In\nany case, your Russian peasant loves\nhis dear soviet and is ready to die in\nits defense, and any Russians who op\npose it are reactionaries, counter-rev\nolutionaries, imperialists, Black Hun\ndreds, and every other thing in the\nradical vocabulary.\nThis glamorous theory of Russian\npolitics has only one little defect\u2014it\nis utterly false and has no foundation\nin fact. It rests on the fanciful inter\npretation by unsound minds of data\nfurnished by a few ignorant and biased\nobservers, who know nothing of the\nRussian people, their life and history,\nand who were singularly susceptible\nto the revolutionary atmosphere in\nwhich they found themselves in Petro\ngrad and Moscow.\nThe soviet, in the sense in which the\nword is now used, is not a natural Rus\nsian institution, and it has no connec\ntion whatever with the mir, or peasant\ncommune, as alleged by Raymond Rob\nins in the hodge-podge of misrepre\nsentations that make up his oratorical\nfantasies. The word is good Russian,\nand means \u201ccouncil.\u201d A board of di\nrectors is a soviet; the upper house\nunder the old regime was called the\nGosudarstvenny soviet, or council of\nthe empire.\nAs now used, the term had its ori\ngin in 1905. When the revolution of\n1905 took place, one phase of it was\nthe attempt of the workingmen to\nseize power. For a short time they\ndominated Petrograd and Moscow. The\npower naturally fell into the hands of\ntheir labor union councils, or soviets.\nThis gave the idea to Trotsky, who\nlater pointed out in his writings that\nthis afforded a handy instrument for\nimposing the dictatorship of the prole\ntariat. It was natural, then, that when\nthe revolution of March, 1917, took\nplace, as the result of a rising of the\nworkmen and soldiers of Petrograd,\nthey should hark back to the precedent\nof 1905.\ni ne soviets oi woriunen ana soiuiers\ndeputies did not, however, at first con\nsider themselves a governing body.\nThey accepted the provisional govern\nment and looked upon themselves as\ncharged with the duty of protecting\nthe interests of the workingmen and\nsoldiers in that government. As the\ndays went by and the provisional gov\nernment showed itself incapable of\nmeeting the situation, the power of\nthe soviets grew. They at first con\ntained a majority of Mensheviks. The\nBolsheviks used the slogan, \u201cAll\npower to the soviets,\u201d effectively, as\nwell as the universal demand for a\ncessation of the war, and in November\ncame into full control, and the soviets\nbecame the government organization\nof Russia. Meanwhile the soviet or\nganization has been extended to the\ntowns and even to the villages, dis\nplacing the zemstvos and peasant in\nstitutions of self-government. Theo\nretically it was supposed to be elec\ntive^; practically, it was self-chosen\nfind was made up of the worst ele\nments of the local population, fre\nquently including released criminals\nand thugs imported from other towns\nand provinces.\nToday the Bolsheviks and the so\nviets are one and the same thing. The\nsoviets could not last a single day\nwithout the support of the mercenary\narmies. The soviet government looks\npretty on paper. It has a constitution\nthat provides for the election of local\nand provincial soviets, for the All\nRussian soviet, for the executive com\nmittee. Presumably any Russian who\nworks for his living, who hires no one,\nwho has no connection with the church\nor with trade, and u-hose political\nviews are approved by the Bolsheviks,\nmay vote for the members of these\nsoviets. In practice they are self\nchosen and self-perpetuating.\nThe fact is that long ago all the\nBolshevik leaders, with the possible\nexception of five or six fanatics, lost\nfaith in the Bolshevik formula\u2014if they\never had any. They now openly scoff\nat such deluded followers as take Bol\nshevism seriously. They are out for\nloot and plunder and to hold their\npower as long as they can and to find\na safe refuge when their orgy is over.\nThey are spending millions of their\nstolen money in propaganda abroad,\npropaganda that seeks, on the one\nhand, to stir tip unrest and revolution,\nand, on the other, to convince the\nwTorld that they are now becoming con\nservative and constructive, and may\nsafely be taken into the family of nar\ntions. It is the plea of the cornered\nthief for immunity and for the reten\ntion of part of his loot on the promise\nof reform.\nAnother phase of the soviet legend\ndeserves comment. There are those\nwho seriously speak of the soviet sys\ntem as an ideal form of democracy,\nwhile decrying Bolshevik excesses\nand extremes. They allege that the\nsoviet means direct and immediate re\nsponsibility of government to the peo\nple. They prate much of some vague\nthing they call \u201cindustrial democracy.\u201d\nBut the soviet idea not only is a death\nblow to liberty and democracy, it\nspells irresponsible tyranny on the\npart of the ignorant and incompetent,\nand brings in its wake economic ruin\nand innumerable petty autocracies.\nHOW THE NEWS IS RECEIVED\nReaders of the Daily Times, regaled\ndaily in their homes or offices through\nthese columns with exact, impartial\nand interesting accounts of happenings\nhere, there and everywhere, possibly\noften wonder at the means by which\nthese results are obtained and how a\npaper in the local field obtains a report\nof the daily doings of the world as\ncomprehensive as that available to the\ngreatest papers in the largest cities on\nthe continent.\nThe answer is contained in the cap\ntion, \u201cBy Associated Press.\u201d These\nfew words, to the initiated, mean that\nin addition to the high class reportor\nial staff known to the city, the Daily\nTimes has another staff composed of\nthe keenest and best newspaper men\nin the world\u2014a staff that instead of\nbeing confined to one city is world\nwide in its territory; that can and\ndoes report on the spot the action of\na city council a hundred miles from\nhere and the deliberations of a peace\ncommission sitting half a world away;\nthat is on duty twenty-four hours in\nthe day on the Mexican border and\nthe Arctic circle; that is as much at\nhome in the tropical jungles or a\nfront line trench as our city hall man\nis in the ante-room of the mayor\u2019s\noffice.\n\u201cBy Associated Press,\u201d seen in these\ncolumns, reflects the co-ordination of\nmore than eleven hundred newspapers\nof the United States in a mutual asso\nciation by which each individual paper\nbecomes the servant of all, and all the\nservants of each.\nThe great metropolitan publications,\nwith their enormous staffs and facili\nties, are at the service of the small\ntown daily.

Nor i it the invention of Plttlbf Jews of\nthe present time, a new political device which has\nbeen set up as a vehicle of the ideas of Lenin and\nTrotsky ; it is of ancient Jewish origin, a device which\nthe Jews themselves invented to maintain their dis\ntinctive racial and national life atnr the conquest of\nPalestine by the Roman.\nModern Bolshevism, which is now known to be\nmerely the outer cloak of a long-planned coup to estab\nlish the domination of a race, immediately set up the\nSoviet form of government because the Jews of all\ncountries who contributed to Russian Bolshevism had\nlong been schooled in the nature and structure of\nthe Soviet.\nThe Soviet appears in the \"Frotcols of the Learned\nElders of Zion\" under the ancient name of KAHAL.\nIn the Seventeenth Protocol this passage occurs :\n\"Even now our brothers are under obligation\nto denounce apostates of their own family or any\nperson known to be opposed to the Kahal. When\nour kingdom comes, it will be necessary for all\nsubjects to serve the state in a similar manner.'\nAnyone who is acquainted with contemporary Jew\nish life knows what this denunciation of apostates\nmeans. The bitterness of the persecution, which falls\nupon a convert to Christianity, or upon the Jewish son\nor daughter of an orthodox family who chooses to\nmarry a Gentile, is without parallel among men. Very\nrecently in a western state a fine Jewish girl chose to\nmarry a Gentile, who was a newspaperman. From the\ntime of her announcement of intention, the girl was\ntreated as an apostate. Had she died a most wretched\ndeath, had she descended to a status of most ignomin\nious -hame, the feelings which her fate would have\naroused could not have been more terrible. A darkly\nsolemn funeral service was held for her, and on her\nbridal day she was declared to be dead to her people.\nThe case is very far from being unusual. Perhaps\none of the most moving descriptions of it is to be\nI u.d in the life of Spinoza, the great philosopher\nwhom modern Jews are fond of holding up for exhibi\ntion as a great ornament of their people. Spinoza's\nstudies led him to question many of the dogmas the\nrabbis taught, those \"commandments of men\" of which\nthe Xew Testament speaks, and as Spinoza was already\na person of influence the very common Jewish tactic\nof bribery was tried upon him.\nThere would be some hesitation in using the words\njust set down 'the very common Jewish tactic of\nbribery\" if they were not known to be true. There is\nno desire to cast aspersions which grow out of malice.\nBut Jewih history a written by Jews provides moun\ntains of proof that bribery was. while present knowl\nedge amply testifies that it still is, the favorite and most\ndependable weapon of the Jews. A Jewish writer,\nJacob trftd Dc Haau, a Dutch lawyer resident in\nJerusalem has recently stated that one hope of a\nsettlement of the Arab agitation in Palestine is the\nease with which the Arab press can be bribed. His\nwords are : \"There is a strong agitation here among\nthe Arabs against what they call the Zionist peril. But\nthe Arabs, especially the Arabian papers, are open tc\nbribe. This weakness will cause them, in the long run.\nto lose out against us.\"\nSo, young Spinoza was offered an annual stipend of\n1,0Q0 florins if he would be silent upon his convictions\nand from time to time show himself at the synagogue.\nThis he refused with high-minded scorn. He made\nready to earn his bread by polishing lenses for optical\ninstruments. Upon this, he was excommunicated, a\nproceeding which is thus described :\n\"The day of excommunication at length arrived, and\na vast concoue assembled to witness the awful cere\nmony. It began by the silent and solemn lighting of\na quantity of black wax candles, and by opening the\ntabernacle whtrein were deposited the books of the\nLaw of Moses. Thus were the imaginations of the\nfaithful prepared for all the horror of the scene The\nchief rabbi, the ancient friend and master, now the\nfiercest enemy, of the condemned, was to order the\nexecution. He stood there pained, but implacable ; the\npeople fixed their eager eyes upon him. High above,\nthe chanter rose and chanted forth in loud lugubrious\ntones the words of execration; while from the opposite\nside another mingled with these curses the thrilling\nsounds of the trumpet. And now the black candles\nwere reversed, and were made to melt drop by drop\ninto a huge tub filled with blood.\" (Lewes: Bio\ngraphical History of Philosophy.)\nThen came the final anathema. \"'With the judg\nment of the angels and of the saints, we excommuni\ncate, cut off, curse and anathematize Baruch de\nEspinoza. with the consent of the elders and all this\nholy congregation, in the presence of the holy books:\nby the 613 precepts which are written therein, with the\nanathema wherewith Joshua cursed Jericho, with the\ncurse which Elisha laid upon the children, and with all\nthe curses which are written in the law. Cursed be he\nby day, and cursed be he by night. Cursed be lie in\nkeeping, and cursed be he in waking, cursed in going\nout. and cursed in coming in. The Lord shall not par\ndon him. the wrath and the fury of the Lord shall\nhenceforth be kindled against tins man, and shall lay\nupon him all the curses written in the Book of the Law\nThe Lord shall destroy his name under the sun, and\ncut him off for his undoing from all the tribes of\nIsrael, with all the curses of the firmament which are\nwritten in the Law nd we warn you that none\nmay speak w ith him by word of mouth nor by writing,\nnor show any favor unto him. nor be under one roof\nwith him. nor come within four cubits of him, nor read\nany paper composed by him.'\" (Pollock: Life of\nSpinoza.)\n\"As the blasting words were uttered, the lights were\nall suddenly immersed in the Mood, a cry of religious\nhorror and execration hurst from all; and in that sol\nemn darkness, and to those solemn curses, they shouted\nAmen. Amen!\" (Professor J. K. Hosmer : The\nJews.)\nThat is a commentary on the decree of denuncia\ntion. It also throws a very strong light on the pres\nsure which is brought SgsJnst many Jews who would\ncrv out against the anti-social ideas of their people, but\nwho dare not because of the penalties it would bring.\nThis denunciation, as Protocol Seventeen orders, is\nto be made against anyone who is \"known to be op\nposed to the Kahal\" or ancient Soviet system of the\nJe w S.\nAfter the destruction of the Jewish state by the\nRomans, the Jews maintained a center in the Patriarch;\nand after the dispersion of the Jews out of Palestine\nthis center of nationality was preserved in the Princ\nof the Kxile. or Kxilarch, an office which is believed\nto persist to the present time, and which some believe to\nhe held now by an American Jew. In spite of all as\nsertions to the contrary, the Jew s hae never ceased to\nhe \"a people\": that is. a consciously united racial group,\ndifferent from all others, and w ith ptirpOM s and ideals\nwhich are strictly of the Jews, by the Jews and for the\nJews in distinction from the rest of the world. That\nthey constitute a nation within the nations, the most\nresponsible Jewish thinkers i i t only declare but in\nsist upon. And this if wholly in accord with the facts\nas observed. Tin Jew not only desires to live apart\nfrom other people, but he works with his own people\nas against others, and he desires as much as possible\nto live under his own laws. In the city f Xew York\ntoday, the Jews have succeeded in establishing their\nown court for the settlement of their own questions ac\ncording to their own laws And that is precisely the\nprinciple of the Soviet-Kahal.\nFrom the first century forward, as any reader can see\nby consulting the Jew ish Encyclopedia, the \"community.\"\n\"assembly'1 r \"Kahal\" has been the center of Jewish\nlife. It was po earlier, in the time of the Babylonian\ncaptivity. And the last official appearance of it was at\nthe Peace Conference, where the Jews, in accordance\nwith then World Program, the only program that\npassed successfully and unchanged through the Peace\nConference, secured for themselves the ritjht to the\nKahal for administrative and cultural purposes m ad\ndition to many other privileges in countries win re their\nactivities had been a matter of protest. The Polish\n'.notion is purely a Jewish question, and Paderewski'i\nfailure as a statesman was entirely due to his domina\ntion by Jewish influences. The Rumanian question is\nlikewise a Jewish question, and all Rumanians speak of\nthe United States as \"The Jews' Countrv\" because they\nkn ow through their statesmen the terrific pressure\nwhich was exerted by American Jews against their\ncountry, a pressure extending to the very necessities of\nlife, and which compelled Rumania to sign agreements\nwhich are as humiliating as those that Austria asked\nof Serbia, out of which the World War grew The\nJewish Question is written all over the forces that\nprovoked the war, and over all the hindrances to peace\nwhich the world has since seen.\nUnder the Kahal or ancient Soviet, the Jews lived\nby themselves and governed themselves, doing busi\nness with the government solely through their repre\nsentatives It was communism in a more drastic form\nthan has been seen anywhere in the world outside\nRussia. Education, health, taxes, domestic affairs, all\nwere under the absolute control of a few men who\nConstituted the ruling board. This board, as the present-day\nJewish hierarchy is supposed to be, was self\nperpetuating, the office often passing in an unbroken\nline of hereditary succession through many genera\ntions. All property was in common, which however\ndid not prevent the leaders becoming rich. These\nKahals or Soviets existed in Rome, France, Holland,\nGermany, Austria, Russia, Denmark, Italy, Rumania!\nTurkey and Kngland. In the United States the idea\nhas developed around the synagogue and around na-\n: sl and international secret societies of lews f\nwhich more will be said in succeeding articles\nThe Kahal is the traditional Jewish ; lrr\ntUtion during the dispersal of the race among the iV\nHons. Its international aspect is to be seen in th\"\nhigher councils. These councils enlarged a the fewi\nspread over the world. The Jewish Encyclopedia cites\nthe Council of Three Lands, the Council 0f Fo\nLands, and the Council of Five Lands, showing an in\"\nternational relationship in earlier years B j;'Ke ajj\nsuch records, public view of them is aof easily acces\nsible so far as they relate to modern times. The re\ncent Zionist Congress in London, where d ibtless\nmuch business was done that pertained to the Jewish\npeople throughout the world, though not in public\nhalls by any means, may be called the Council 0f\nThirty-Seven Lands, for the delegates to that congress\ncame from all parts of the world, from points remote\nas Lapland and South Africa, Persia and Xew Zea\nland. The purpose of these World Councils was the\nunification of the Jews, and the records of their as\nsemblages run back through the centuries.\nIt is therefore no new thing that l as arisen in\nRussia.

Mere discussion\nof them depends on what you mean by\n\"retting on,\" also on what you mean\nby Bolshevism. The word is loosely\nused by many speakers and writers In\ndenouncing all aorta of Red radicalism,\nevery kind of social and Industrial\nagitation. Such confusion makes the\nreal Bolshevist smile. But ho seems\nto be avoiding the name, as If under\nstanding that the American public\nshies at It. He prefers to call him\nself a Communist or a representative\nof or believer In the Russian Scrvlet\nGovernment.\n\"Soviet\" simply means council or\ncommittee. The Russian machinery\nof government Is a pyramid of councils,\nthe email local ones choosing delegates\nto larrer, regional ones, which In turn\nchoose delegates to the national coun\ncil, very much as If our caucus and\nconvention nominating system were\nturned Into a standing governing af\nfair. There is certainly a mission or\nbureau of the Russian Soviet Govern\nment openly established and doing\nbusiness In New Tork. The business\nIt avows Is commercial and diplo\nmatic. It makes no bones of main\ntaining a bureau of Information, which\nIssues a weekly bulletin of \"the truth\"\nas opposed to propaganda \"lies\" about\nthe Soviet Government. Any one can\nhave this bulletin by calling and ask\ning for It.\nThere Is also a monthly publication\ncalled The Liberator, whose namo Is\nIn the telephone book and on tho street\ndoor of an oftlco building fronting on\nUnion Square. The Liberator Is a\nfrank, rancorous, fighting propagan\ndist, on behalf not only of Soviet Rus\nsia but of every other faction violently\n\"agin\" any \"capitalistic Government\"\nin the world, Its appeal Is elemental\nto class hatred. Its editors are Amer\nicans.

Th Question is\nwhether their teaching had taken on\nr new radical color since tno last\nrovolutlon In Russia.\nBolshevism and lite Socialists.\nv.i.h.viin a variety of Socialism,\none of the flfty-nln varieties omj of\nthe oldest and easily the most radical\nof them all. It calls Itself Socialism\nnow and even tho fairly moderate\nlights of the Socialist patty In New\ntork are beginning to acknowledge it\nus such a thinr they were loath to do,\nfor publication, at least. 'W\nBolsBflvism Is not anarchy, and m the\nother hand, the American .Federation\nof Labor, for Instance, Is hated by,\nBolshovlsts almost as bitterly as cap\nital Is.\nTho Russian Soviet Government Is\ncrude Marxian Socialism or commun\nism In action. The Bolshevists say It\nIs not. However they esteem Karl\nMarx they don't like the suggestion\nthat Lenlno has not Improved on him.\nBut the differences they try to point\nout aro metaphysical. The Marx\nEngels Communist Manifesto divided\nsociety Into proletariat and bourgeoisie,\nthe latter being anybody who owns\nproperty, from a chain of factories\ndown to a modest bank account earn\ning Interest. It proposed tho over\nthrow of the bourgeoisie by tho prole\ntarians of the cities, to be followed by\nthe \"emancipation\" of all wage earn\ners, and tho rearrangement of the\nwhole of society on a common level.\nNational linos as we know them,\nlike class lines, were to disappear.\nPrivate property was to cease to be.\nWhile everybody was to have to work,\nnobody was to have to do more work\nthan was necessary to produce his\nlivelihood. \"The hlvo subsists on the\nlnval honey which the hive produces.\"\nas a wax moth explains In an allegory\nabout beea. by Kipling, which Social\nists do not enjoy. All Instruments of\nproduction were to be \"centralized in\nthe hands of the fltate that is, of\ntho proletariat organized as tho ruling\nclass,\" until there should no longer be\nclat.s distinctions, but only a homo\ngeneous community.\nSo far as this thumbnail sketch goes\nit Is an accurato likeness of funda\nmentals of tho Marx idea, likewise of\nthe things the Communist leaders are\ntrying to work out in Russia and to\nfoster everywhere else.\nIVhrn la a Soviet JVot a Soviet T\nNew York has been, hearing rumors\nthat Soviets ore secretly forming on\nthe East Side. During one strike of\ngarment workers last winter there was\na report that a Soviet was concerned.\nAny knot of tea shop talkers can call\nItself a Soviet If It likes tho name; so\ncan any group of Industrial workers.\nTo say tho system of Soviets, with a\ncentral direction, was secrotly form\ning in preparation for a revolutionary\nattempt would bo another thing. Noth\ning has Indicated that such construc\ntive plotting Is going on. A good\nground for assuming It Is not is the\npresent policy of the Russian Soviet\nGovernment toward the United States\nGovernment.\nThey want railroad and factory ma\nchinery from our manufacturers and\nother trade, and they are playing for\nrecognition. For tho present, at least,\nthey are putting their best foot fore\nmost and endeavoring to make a\nfavorable Impression upon Washing\nton and the American people. Dis\nclosure of any sort of plotting in\nwhich they were concerned would undo\nthee efforts at once.\nOn tho other hand, Lenlne, unless he\nhas been misquoted revrral times In\ntho last year by Interviewers presum\nably sympathetic and over his own\nsignature In tho Liberator itself, is\nconvinced that a proletarian revolu\ntion is Impending In America, and Is\nconstantly askjiig Americans he sees\nIf It has not already begun.\nSo much is speculative. What fol\nlows ia a trngibla condition which even\n'\nHHHIGBiaHaaBHS HBiPkws\na hireling of the capitalist press, mak-.\nIng the New York radical and not so\nradical rounds, Is quick to notice.\nTho younger champions and follow\ners of every sort of social and indus\ntrial \"causa\" aro stimulated by what\nhas happened In Russia and by tho\noutlook there as they see It. It excites\nthem as a combat of antlcred stags Is\nsaid to excite all tho yearling bucks\nround about. It gives them hope.\nEven If their tenets ure different from\nLenlne's his have got action, and on\na national scale. Older and calmer\nr.p'rlts ore quick to say the Bolshevists\nhavo been grossly misrepresented and\nought to bo left alone In Russia to\nwork out tho salvation of their ex\nperiment. Tatting an IX t \"Kvolatlon.\"\nParlor Socialists, so called, thinkers\nwith college degrees who Knilled at\nLenlne's \"naive Marxian Ideas\" not\nlong ago, now see a great deal In So\nviet Russia, and somo of them are\nspelling social \"evolution\" with an It.\nJust how tho I. W. W. people and the\nanarchists aro feeling The Sun re\nporter only knows from hearsay, but\nthere Is no doubt that tho present un\ndisputed domination of tho Bolshevists\nIn Russia looks to all such elements\nlike the red dawn of tholr long awaited\nday, and Lenlne is frequently quoted\nas wishing them well and solicitously\ninquiring how they are getting on.\nThe kind of East Bide crowds Uiat at\ntend and furnish the noise for every\nvariety of class conscious and vituper\native \"people's meeting ' arc, of course,\ntremendously worked up.\nMoreover, a great many thoroughly\nsane and thoroughly loyal native\nAmericans seem to bs taking a new,\ninquiring interest in Soviet Russia, of\nwhich they feel that their previous\nmental conception, gained from as\nsorted nnd contradictory accounts, Is\na vague nightmare. They think it\nwould be worth while to have the facts.\nThe Prtnktpo conference proposal, the\ndebates on a Russian policy at ver\nsallies, and now the tolrratton of a\nSoviet Russian mission In New York\nmay have something to do with this\nfeeling. Or It may be a sort of re\naction, now that the war and the re\nseutment of Russia's collapse as an\nally are bfhlnd us. It doesn't by any\nmeans Imply that Bolshevism Is com\ning Into good odor, only that people\nhave read so much about \"propa\nganda\" of one kind and another that\nthey havo arrived at a sceptical at\ntitude toward the foreign news.\nThe Bolshevists In New York sense\nsuch reaction, overestimate It, and\nbank on it. One of their explanations\nof It Is particularly entertaining, as\nwill appear in a moment. They be\nlleve American capital wants to do\nbusiness with. Soviet Russia more than\nJOHN\nit fears social unrest In this country,'\nand that it Is fostering a 'change of\npublic opinion with that end In view.\nTheir mission has taken the trlrd\nfloor of the Tower Building, at 110\nWest Fortieth street, a neighborhood\nwhere office rent comes high. If it\nfinds itself cramped for room It ex\npects to take another floor. \"Bureau\nof Soviet Russia\" Is on the glass of\nthe doors for all the world to read.\nThe full stylo affected by tho Lenlne\nTrotzky Government, as you learn\nfrom the mission's literature. Is \"Rus\nsian Socialist Federal 8ovIet, Repub\nlic.\" The word Federal may or may\nnot be put In to disarm tho ultra\nconservative.\nTho offices just now are full of lum\nber and telephone wire and hammer\ning, but the Bolshevists keep office\nhours none the less. Thero Is a great\ndeal of heavy mahogany furniture.\nEverything looks like prosperity and\nconfidence, not to say ossuranco. An\nEnglishman would comment that the\nmission was \"doing itself well.\" An\nAmerican would wonder at tho \"over\nhead.\" which wouldn't fit In with his\nnotions of a proletarian regime at all.\nTho official representative and head\nof tho mission In Ludwlg C. A. K.\nMartens, described as an eminent\nmechanical engineer, forty-four years\nold, born In southern Russia, and for\nthe last few years American represen\ntative of tho Demldoff Iron and Steel\nWorks. He does not sen newspaper\nmen. That is done by Santort Nuor\nteva. secretary of the mission and\nchief of its diplomatic bureau. He'\nmust be about the same ngc a com\nfortable little man with a twinkling\neye and a quiet, cnergetio way of\ntalking. Ho used to be In the Par\nliament of tho Finnish republic. Ills\nassociates call him a great diplomat.\nHe first came to tho United States\nlive years ago, and for the last year,\nhe says, he has conducted un Informa\ntion bureau, trying to meet tho \"lies\"\nabout Soviet Russia with truth.\nReporters Made Welcome.\nHis bureau Is now an Important\nsource of news to the Socialist pa\npers, and ho sees tholr reporters dally.\nBut he Is equally cordial to a hire\nling of the capitalist press. At making\nthe \"newspaper boys\" welcomo no\nPresidential aspirant's campaign\npress agent could beat him. He apolo\ngizes for the hammering nnd disorder\nIn the offices you must comn again\nwhen everything Is fixed up. Yes. in\ndeed! ho can glvo you some facts that\nwill make I. very nice little Sunday\nstory. But It will take him an hour\nor two. Could you come to-morrow\nmorning at 9, or would that be too\nearly!\nIn the atmosphero there Is no ner\nvousness, no distrust no fear, to put\nit coarsely, of being pinched. Nor Is\nthere either bravado or obnequlous\nncss. Tho mission and its office force\nknow their business. They comport\nthemselves as It a Bolshevist Junta\nIn New York at a time when Bolshe\nvist troops and American soldiers are\nfighting wero tho most natural thing\nIn tho world. In tho same way. Nuor\nteva gives his interview. He talks\ncandidly. Ho makes no effect of be\ning on his guard; in fact, he makes\ntho opposite effect, letting drop a few\nthings iriono of them at all startling)\nwhich \"it would not do to publish at\ntills time,\" and taking your good faith\nfor granted.\nThe mission's two occupations, he\nsays, are the locating of Russian Gov\nernment property In the United States\nand tho establishment of connections\nwith American manufacturers and tho\nplacing of tentatlvo contracts with\nAmerican manufacturers, conditioned\non tho lifting of the \"embargo.\" which\nisn't an embargo, against Soviet Rus\nsia, and ability to obtain exporter's\nlicenses.\nSeelclnjr GoTerruiient Property\nTho Russian Government property\nIn question amounts, he says, to 800,\n000.000 in nil. Llttto If any of It Is\nwar munitions, as all Russian orders\nof thoso got as far as Archangel. The\nproperty Is n heritage, or tho Bolshe\nvists hopo to make It one, from the\nformer Russian regimes. At present\ntho representatives of tho formor\nregimes, being without funds, are\nturning somo of tho property Into ready\nmoney. The Soviet mission will plac\nclaims and try to have that traffic\nstopped. Their status before Amort\ncan courts depends on the attltudo of\ntho State Department, cut they count\non early practical, If not formal, recog\nnition. \"The property,\" said Nuorteva, \"in\ncludes, for Instance, several thousands\nof units of a manufactured product\nI won't name It that Is always mar\nketable and sells for ISO.

T'ey know of that\nGovernment property, and taking tho\nchance of our being recognized and\ngetting title to It they nre offering to\npay us for options expecting to get\n10,000.000 worth of goods for $2,000.\n000. They take us for crooks like\nthemselves. Wo tell them to go and\nchase themselves.\" ho said laughing.\nThe general Implication seemed to bo\nthat the Bolshevist representatives ex\npect American capital to foster recog\nnition of their Government, to In\nfluence public opinion that way for the\nsake of the profits from trado with\nRussia, our markets with England and\nFrance being \"virtually cln.sed.\"\nNuorteva also Hpoko of the \"psycho\nlogical reaction\" in America. He thinks\ntho \"lies\" maligning Soviet Russia\nhave been overdone.

Vanderlip was\nused as an unconscious disseminator of\nBolshevist propaganda or not. From\n! Jacob H. Rubin of Milwaukee The New i\nYork Herald received yesterday a letter\nwhich asserts that Mr. Vanderlip\nwas so picked upon. On tho other hand,\nMr. Vanderlip issued a circular pub- j\nlished by the National Hands Off Russia\nCommittee. 11 Oxford street, London,\nthat gave Mr. Vanderlip a clean bill of\ncommercial health.\nFirst of all. Mr. Rubin, now in Stockholm.\nwrites that he was in Moscow at\nthe timo Mr. Vanderlip was there, and |\nthat he knows the latter was seized |\nupon by NIcolai Lenine as an American\nmade to order for the predicament\nof the moment: that Russia could well\nafford to grant Mr. Vanderlip contracts\n1 | and concessions that were quite impossible\nof fulfilment in order to fire the\ndying Bolshevist sentiment in Great\nBritain and America with the idea that\nthe capitalists of both countries were\n' disposed to lose money rather than give\nthe Soviet Republic a chance for Its life.\nMr. Kubln. referring all who question\nhis Identity to his son Vietor, a member\nof the staff of the Milwaukee Journal,\nsnya that he has \"Just returned from a\n; ten months' visit in Soviet Russia,\nwhere he was detained by the Government.\"\nHe adds that he is now on his\ni way , back to the United States.\nExtract* Krom Tetter.\nHis letter, in part, follows:\n\"Mr. Vanderlip represented himself to\nbe a personal representative of Senator\nHarding, Republican Presidential candidate.\nHe was then negotiating with the\n1 Soviet Government to obtain a concesI\nsiOn of several hundred thousands of\n| acres of land in eastern Siberia ; also a\ni contract from said Government of all\npurchases made in the United States,\namounting to approximately $3,000,000,,\n000, to go through Vanderlip & Co.\n\"Mr. Vanderlip was very elated over\nhis project and had a very high opinion\nof the Soviet Government. He told me\nthat he was treated royally and that\nI\nIt\nF\nI MEN'S\n3800c\nII 4600o\nMEN'S\nINo use i\ncolorings,\nwhat you\nhowever,\ncoats are 1\n?\n\\\nTHE N?\n? ?=*\nthere !s no reason for complaint against\ntlie said Government. Of course I understand\nthut Mr. Vatulerllp had no reason\nto complain. He waif given a beautiful\nmansion to live in : he was well fed\nand provided with all the luxuries obtainable\nin Moscow.\n\"Did he try to study the actual conditions\nin Soviet Russia? There la not one\nbuilding In Moscow, Petrograd, Odessa.\nKhurtow or any other large city In Soviet\nRussia that is not sadly neglected;\nthe plumbing Is defective, the woodwork\ntorn down for fuel and kindling wood.\nThe elevators ure out of commission,\nthere Is no running water, the window\npanes broken, the floors rotting from\ndampness. Xinoty-tlve per cent, of the\nRussiun population are underfed and\nhave not sufficient clothes and shoes;\nabout 15 per cent, are suffering from typhus\non account of the filthy and unsanitary\nconditions prevailing in the entire\nSoviet Kusiu.\n1.1 fe Is Not Secure.\nt\n\"Thousands of men are arrested each\nday for various crhn. s. such as selling or\nbuying provisions, changing money, having\npublic meetings without a permit\nfrom the tchailia. Thousands of houses\nare raided and everything of any value\nfound is confiscated; hundreds of men\nare shot daily without a trial by court or\nJury; graft and oribery are flourishing\na great deal more than under the Tsar's\nregime.\n\"Some of the leaders in the Soviet\nGovernment are accumulating fortunes;\nthere is no freedom of speech or press;\nstrikes and protest meetings are subdued.\n\"Children are running around barefoot\nand ragged, selling dirty sugar and\nbread under cover. The people are ruled\nwith an Iron hand. No one knows what\nwill happen to-morrow. No one Is secure\nwith his life.\n\"In the name of starving humanity\nof Soviet Russia T appeal to the Government\nof the United States not to\nsanction Vanderlip's project. The Soviet\nGovernment cannot last very long. One\nhalf the Government Is watching the\nother half. According to their own reports\nthere are only R75.O00 party members,\nwhich means that only one-third\nof 1 per cent, of the population of Russia\nare Communists.\n\"The Soviet Government?I mean by\nthat Rpnine, Trotzky & Co.?were looking\nhigh and low to find the right man\n(V... tlio >-1 <-1. f T>U? 1\nfoe an advance agent to advertise their\nbig show in the United States.

What difference does it\nmake to Soviet Russia to give away\nton,001) acres of land? Russia can\nstand it.\n\"Vanderllp thought he bluffed Lenlne,\nTrotsky & Co. Lenlne. Trotzky & Co.\nreturned the compliment. I think it Is\na bluff game nil through. The object of\nSoviet Russia in granting Mr. Vanderllp\nconcessions, as stated above. Is for cnty\ncn? purpose, and that is propaganda. In\nmy opinion Mr. Vanderllp is doing more\nbarm In misrepresenting the facts of\nRussia than all the Bolsheviks In the\nUnited States at present.\"\nIn refutation of this comes the statement\nfrom the National Hands Off Russia\nCommittee of London, which is\nprinted in the shape of a dodger. 1.000,000\nof which, according to Mr. Vanderllp,\nwere distributed throughout Great\nBritain, particular attention being given\nthe hordes of the unemployed In London,\nManchester and Liverpool.\nAcross the top of the first page of the\ndodger appears the heading \"British\nWorkers Unemployed\" In large black\nmi\\\nclct\nfor\n'ebruary rei\n; and You\nOriginally to 55\nOriginally 60 & 65\n& YoungM\n1500 5C\nparticularizing as\nQuantities are\nr preference, we\nwe wish to impi\nfrom our own sh\nNo Charge fo\nt\nFifth Avenue at 3\nEstablish\nf\nYOkK HiiiiALD, iv\ntype.

The Chicago Daily\nNews Co.)\nMoscow, Russia, April 1\">.?There\nare three positive things that the allies\ncan ilo for Russia and incidentally\nfor themselves in Russia. One\nis to foster Russian resentment\nagainst Germany and also encourage\nthe revolutionary spirit for war. The\nsecond is to preserve in Russia the\nspirit of democracy for which the allies\nare lighting. Third, by saving\nthe Russian democracy we shall shut\nout the Germans in larire measure\nami upon Russia fur ourselves as the\nworld's greatest future market for\nmanufactured articles.\nThere are two negative things the\nallies can do. hirst, they should do\nnothing that will ultimately turn the\ncountry over to the Germans. Second,\nthey should make no concerted\ninvasion of Siberia and they should\nnot permit Japan to invade Siberia,\nfor such an invasion would immediately\nresult in the turning of Russian\nresentment away from Germany\nand against the allies. The invasion\nof Siberia would result in the fall of\nthe soviet government, a German eontrolled\ngovernment replacing it in\nEurope and a Japanese controlled\ngovernment replacing it in Siberia.\nNeither of those empires wishes Russian\ndemocracy to succeed. Autocracy\nis lonely. A Japanese invasion of Si\nberia cither with or without the cooperation\nof the allies would be the\nmost serious blow that could befall\nthe allies in Russia.\nI.enine Talks of War W ith Japan\nIf we are able to assure the soviet\ngovernment that such a move will not\noccur we shall see a wonderful change\nin the Russian situation in the next\nsix months. The recent Japanese\nlanding at Vladivostok gives an indication\nof Russian sentiment. Lenine,\nspeaking the other day on this subject,\nsaid:\n\"We may have to declare war on\nJapan because the Japanese imperialists\nwish to annex sections of free\ndemocratic Siberia. Serious complications\nwith England and France\nwould he nrohahle and it. ninv result\nin war should they, as allies of Japan,\nbe unable to restrain her spoliation of\nSiberia.\"\nLeon Trotzky says openly that Japan\nand Germany have reached an\nagreement, although, in view of Germany's\nattitude in the far east, that\nsounds improbable. Nevertheless, the\nsoviet leaders declare that they intend\nto fight Japan should she continue\nthe movement toward Siberia.\nThey insist Japan has searched for\nnumerous pretexts for an invasion of\nSiberia and the occupation of Vladivostok\nand the Siberian littoral.\nGerman Prisoners Not Arming\nThere were rumors for a time that\nGerman war prisoners in Siberia\nwere arming themselves with the object\nof seizing the Trans-Siberian\nrailroad. 1 lus was disproved by a\nspecial American and British committee\nof investigation. During the\nGerman drive on the western front\nihe Japanese suggested that an invasion\nof Siberia might cause a diversion\nof German troops from that\nfront. Any sane military judgment\nwould disprove this theory, yet the\nFranco-British general staffs requested\nGen. I'ershing to use his influence\nin Washington to bring about the\nplan suggested.\nWhen Japan shall invade Siberia\nhere is what will happen in Uussia: j\nFirst, the soviet will declare war\non Japan and send against thatrcoun\ntl J? C4II ?V<l|iUi'U 41I.IL ell U 11 WW\npreparing to fight against Germany.\nSecond, it will recall all the soviet\ntroops now lighting a guerilla war-1\nfare aKam^t Germany in the Ukraine\nand will send them to Siberia to\nfight against the .lapane.se. Such ac-j\ntion will injure the western front, because\nthe lino,ouo soviet irregulars in\nthe Ukraine are now detaining a certain\nnumber of German troops.\nThird, the soviet will immediately\nappeal to Germany to aid Russia in\nlighting Japan, because, although\nRussian resentment against Germany\nis now growing by leaps and bounds,\nthere exists a ready made resentment\nagainst Japan. That is the reason\nwhy Germany wants Japan to invade\nSiberia. This would forestall the\nfuture conflict of Germany with the\nnew revolutionary army and would\nturn a potential enemy of Germany\ninto a certain ally.\nHow America May Co-Operate\nIf A merica decides to give strong\nco-operation with the soviet forces,\nhere is an immediate program that\nmay be suggested:\nSend American army officers of\nevery branch of the military service\ntjiimbprinj' from fnrt\\r t.r? 9ffff for the\npurpose of helping to organize the\nnew revolutionary army and advising\nits leaders regarding strategy.\n2. Send five to ten oil experts?\nmen w-h* can get oil out of the ground\n? for the purpose of taking part in\nthe reorganization of the Baku oil\nfield.\n:i. Semi five to ten coal experts to;\nget coal out of the ground in the i\nDonetz basin.\n1. Send a commission on other natural\nindustries like iron into the\n| Urals, and so on.\n5. Send a finance commission to aid I\n| the soviet in solving the Russian fijiiancial\nmuddle, ignoring for the time\nbeing the repudiation of debts, which,!\nI believe, will not be permanent. Our\nlegal position regarding the repudia\ntion is secure through the allied pro;\ntest concerning it.\nHuy Up Russian Products\n(?. Send an industrial commission\nfor the purpose of purchaing articles\nin Russia and shipping them to\nAmerica, so as to prevent these ar.\ntides from going to Germany. This\nwill be in the nature of an extended\nblockade. Russia will exchange raw\nmaterials, such as flax, platinum,\nI hides and so on, on the basis of bar1\nter.\n-! 7 Appoint a commission in America\nfor the purpose of arranging tonnage\nand selecting certain supplies\nand American manufactured articles,\n1 choosing those which Russia needs\n, most and sending them to the Russian\nports of Vladivostok, Archangel\nand Murmonsk. Ir? the same bottoms\nthat bring the manufactured articles\nremove raw materials of equal\nvalue that would go to England.\nj K. Establish immediate credits in\nAmerica for the purpose of purchasing\nmanufactured articles intended\nfor Russia, which would be exchanged\nfor an equal value in raw materials\non reaching a Russian port.\n'.). Prevent immediately the available\nnatural resources of Russia from\ngoing to Germany through taking\nthem ourselves and sending back to\nRussia just sufficient manufactured!\narticles to pay for them. Thus Rus-j\nsia's debt to the allies will not be in-,\ncreased, while Germany will be deprived\nof large quantities of needed i\nI war material.\nj Hundred Americans on the Way\nSome allied co-operation has already\nbeen started. Today there are\n| five allied military missions working\nthat are close in the confidence of\nTrotzky and other leaders engaged in\nI organizing the new revolutionary\nI army. One hundred American railIway\nperators are traversing ?danjchuria\non their way to help the soviet\ni ?nfnoll? -e\nuvvuuiij vvr cvavuatc lIlUlULlUIld XIUII1\nPetrograd to> points beyond the Volga\nand out of reach of the Germans\nshould they again advance. The soviet\nis showing extreme willingness\nto place the munitions beyond the\nreach of the Germans. This of itself\nshould be evidence of its good faith.\nHere is a general summary of the\nsituation: The bolsheviki used socialistic\nformulas for the purpose of\nobtaining control of the Soviet's organization\nand outsing Kerensky. The\nsoviet power is permanent, unless\nit is deposed by German or Japanese\ninperialistic force. The soviet government\ntoday is not socialistic.\nI Neither is it a proletariat dictatorship,\nbecause the soviet government\nlis founded on the power of the soviet\n! organization, which, in turn, is!\n| founded on a Slav basis, the principle1\nof which is democracy or the village'\nm i r.\n; . I\nNinety-three per cent of the people!\n! belong to the proletariat or the peas-J\n| ant masses. The other 7 per cent are|\nmonarchists, nobles, capitalists and j\nlandowners. These are the ones who|\njcomplajn of a porletarait dictatorship.\nRussian Democracy Will Not Die\nI\nRussia is rather suffering from\n| birth pains than death throes. The\nsoviet is championing a new form of\ndemocracy. While essentially different\nfrom the Anglo-Saxon idea, it is,\nreal democracy nevertheless, which,\nwith the passage of time, will cer-'\ntainly spread into Slavic Austria. Democracy\nis the idea underlying the\nallies' struggle. The Russian Soviet's\nI democracy will never die, regardless\nof the allied attitude. The country\nis strong of freedom, but unless the\nallies support it perhaps Germany\nor Japan will succeed either in stifling\nor rifling it.\nDemocratic Russia is getting angry\nwith Germany for the first time since (\nthe world war began. The Russians\nnow fell Germany as an individual\nmenace; previously they thought (\nGermany menaced only the czar.\nThe western world does not seem\nto understand Japan's landing at\nVladivostok. Japan's movement toward\nSiberia threatens to turn Russian\nresentment from Germany to Japan\nand Japan's allies, because the .\nallies are unable to check Japan.\nSituation Better for the Allies\nThe Russian situation is better for\nthe allies today than at any other\ntime since the revolution began.\nThere are potentialities, that will\nmaterially aid us to win the world <\nwar. Had we known Russian psy- \\\ncology or spent as much time studying\nRussia as Germany spent we i\nshould have understood. We were i\nlike the boy testing the water with ]\nhis big toe, hesitating to take the ]\nplunge. I\nLet us get abaar-d. Let us play our,]\nally's government for better or for\nworse, lest Germany beat us to it!\nCItOWDER PRAISES\nWORK OF BOARDS\nMore Than Million and Half Men\nMobilized With Last Twelve\nMonths\nRegistration yesterday of another\nmillion young men, who have become\n121 years old within the last 12 months,\nj brought from Provost Marshal General\nCrowder figures indicating the\nmobilization of 1,5015,708 men by the\nlocal boards, within the year. The\nprovost marshal emphasizes the faithful\nand loyal effort of the local and\ndistrict boards, on whom practically\nthe entire hulk of the work fell.

There\nhave been here and there moments of\ndisorder, but our defeats were never\nthe cause. I will explain that. At the\nbeginning, after our revolution, ohr\nmilitary situation was desperate, Vtc\nwere attacked and you remember -'\nproposed amicable settlements by in\ntermediary of the Scandinavian count\nries. That failing, we appealed to tV\nworking cb.sses. liven among us there\nwere many persons who doubted the\nsuccess of this appeal.

In the first, place the peasant\nis not a Communist. One must be as\nUtopian as the Social Revolutionaries\nto believe that. Even at this moment,\nthey do not like the Soviet -.regime.\nRemember thai Inst Spring the troops\nof Dcsikin were marching ahead. They\nbad taken from us all the rich wheat,\nfields, There remained for us only sev\noral prn inces, Tambov Penza, Voro\nneje, Knrks, Saratov and Simbyrisk\nfrom which we could pet wheat and\nbosses.\n\"Tin\" result was that the terrible\neffort we were forced to make bore\nheavily upon the peasants in certain\ndistricts.

The Toiler is glad to be able to\ngive its readers the following official report\nby the Chairman of the Delegation.\nThe reception of the British delegat\nion in Russia was most enthusiastically\nhearty. The Trade Union bodies were\nchiefly responsible for the welcome ar\nrangements. The Russians were evidently\ndelighted that a responsible group of\npeople had arrived from another country\nto investigate the truth about things, and\nhold out warm hands of fr'endslpp to us.\nHAS THE DELEGATION BEEN\nMISLED.'\nAll tho stories of organized camou\nflage tn deci ive m aire nonsense. No great\ner preparations wore made Tor us than\nwould naturally he made to welcome a\nfriendly delegation coming to a country\nwhich had been closed for so long to the\nnulside world.

A number of\nour delegates could speak French and\nGerman, which many of those whom wo\ninterviewed spoke, whilst Mr. Roden 8nx\nt'di both understood nnd spoke consider\nable Russia. Where other interpreters were\nnecessary we were not limited to Bolshe\nviks. We frequently had Mensheviks to\nact in this capacity.\nThe reports that Russia is in a eon\ndition of savage anarchy are totally un\ntrue. Tho suggestion that one cannot go\nabout the streets without seeing indicat\nions ol murder and rapine is simply rid\niculous. We COilid walk about the streets\nof PetrogTad or Moscow, day or nijrhi\ntpiite as freely as one can about tho streets\nof London.\nTMK HUNGER DUE TO THE\nBLOCKADE.\nThe chief thins tha) hurtus was the\nevidence of the hunger In the cities, In\nPetrogfad more so thai) in Moscow.

The\nlack of food stuffs nnd the consequent\nhunger is due to the long years of war,\nInternal eruptions, breakdown of trans\nport hick of materials, and worn out\nmachinery. The Allies' policy of the block\nade and military intervention is, of course,\nchiefly responsible for these things.\nThe hunger in the towns is in strange\ncontrast with the seemiiifr prosperity in\n(Chairman of the British Labor Delegation to Russia)\nwhen external wars have concluded and\nthe internal unity nrisinj? from the com\nmon dangers and difficulties is less operat\nive.

The health organization of the Soviet\ngovernment is marvellous. Russia has suf\nferred terribly from cholera, typhus, small\npox, influenza, and other diseases. War\nalways brings pestilence and famine and\nRussia has bad them to tho full.\nThe Bolsheviks have mot these dif\nficulties by herculean measures, despite\npart of the wage is the ration of broad and\nother food stuffs, which are distributed\nthrough the machinery of tho trade unions,\ntrade unions organize co-operative buy\ning for such goods as are not rationed.\nFurther, as food is difficult to got from\ntrade unions organize co-operative buying\nfor such goods as are not rationo!.

A ve y\nlarge number of the old wooden shacks\nin which the work people previously lived\nhave been pulled down, nnd tho large\nhouses which formerly belonged to the\nw ll to do have been converted into Work\nfirs' dwellings.

The\nSoviet representatives pointed out that\nthey had done no more, far as intend\ning persons of \"enemy\" iKitionality was\nconcerned, then was done by tho British\ngovernment during the war.\nTHE POLISH OFFENSIVE.\nAll the Russian people believe that\nthe Allies and the British Government are\nsupporting the Polish offensive.

Bialik, once so erect and\nstately, is now bent with cafe and\nmarked with the sorrowg of war\nand the persecutions of a troub\nled regime. The long period of\ndistress, however, seems not to\nhave cooled his enthusiasm nOr\nchecked his desire for activity\nnor yet made his poetic fire burn\nany the lower. Though his orig\ninal intention had been to go\nfrom Constantinople immediate\nly to Jerusalem, he informed me\nthat his plans were now changed\nand that, instead, he would visit\nthe important Jewish centers in\nEurope with a view of obtaining\nthe financial means necessary for\nthe establishment of one im\nmense Hebrew publication house\nin Jerusalem in which he would\nendeavor to concentrate the pro\nduction of Hebrew writings and\nfrom which publications in the\nHebrew tongue would be dis\ntributed the world over.\nAsked how he had been grant\ned the exceptional privilege of\nleaving Soviet Russia at this\ntime, Bialik explained in these\nwords:\n\"Of late, the conditions of a\ngroup of authors including my\nself and nine others resident in\nOdessa had reached an almost\nimpossibly distressing climax.\nIn our despair we addressed our\nselves to Maxim Gorky, the fa\nmous Russian author who, we\nknew, had considerable influence\nwith the powers that be in Mos\ncow. We explained that since\nwe had been placed in the 'non\nuseful' category by the Soviet au\nthorities there ought to be no ob\njection to our leaving the coun\ntry. A letter to this effect, and\ngiving all the details of our case,\nwas dispatched through a cer\ntain Mr. Sedoy, a well-known\njournalist. Two months later,\nthe same Sedoy returned to\nOdessa from Moscow bringing\nus the happy news that Gorky\nhad interviewed Lenin on our\nbehalf and that Russia's rulers\nhad consented to our departure.\nI was fearful however, that the\npermission would not be forth\ncoming for a long period because\nof the maze of official red tape\nthrough which our papers would\nhave to pass, and none too cer\ntain that our lives would be safe\ntill the end of that period I has\ntened to Moscow together with\nmy colleague, Kleinman.\nWe arrived there at a most un\nfortunate hour.

Lunatcharsky, Com\nmissare of Education and many\nother Russian intellectuals, had\nintended giving us a great fare\nwell dinner in the \"Presse\nHome\" in Moscow but the 'Jef~\nsek' interfered and the banquet\ndid not take place.

Following the\nrevolution of the Finnish socialists,\n?which resulted In a protracted civil\nwar. the Finnish senate?during the\ncivil war known as the white guard\ngovernment?applied to Germany for\naid. Germany gave the requested aid,\nbut demanded in exchange a mort\ngage on Finland's future. That mort\ngage appears about to fall due, If\npress reports which tell of large\nGerman . reinforcements landing In\nFinland can be credited.\nThe whole Finnish-German-allied\nquestion is one which has grown very\ncomplex. Its origin was simple?the\ncause was hunger, the solution was\nfood. Lj?st summer the government\nof Finland begged the allies to send\nfood to Finland to prevent famine.\nThe allies found that request impos\nsible to meet. The Finns then said\nthey would be forced to turn to ~eJ\"\nmany. The Finnish senate did turn\nto Germany, but the Finnish laborers,\nthe Finnish socialists, turned to so\\tet\nRussia. Civil war resulted and Ger\nmany came with armed force 1to 1tne\naid of her secret ally, the Finnish\ndiet.\nSituation Viewed Generally.\nThis article does not go into detail\non the Finnish question, but simply\ntreats it in a general way. so that the\nreader will have some idea of the re\nlationship of various elements in Fin\nland and Russia ttfaprd each other,\nand also the relationship of the soviet\npower in Russia toward the allied\nforces at Mourman.\nOn April 8 the foreign office or tne\n?oviet government received a fran\ntic telegram from the president or\nthe Mourman soviet. This telegram\nasked that the permission of the cen\ntral government be obtained for tne\nlanding of British marines, then in\nMourman harbor, for the purposes or\nprotecting the Mourman railway from\nthe advancing Finnish-German troops.\nThere were great quantities of war\nstores of various nature at Mourman\nand the council of people's commissars\nin Moscow gave unanimous consent\nto the landing of allied troops for the\nprotection of these.\nOn May 27 representatives of the\nFrench and American governments\nparticipated in a full meeting of the\nMourman soviet, each making state\nments as to the allied intentions re\ngarding the forces at Mourman. Lieut.\nMartin of the American military mis\nsion in Russia made a statement in\nwhich he said: \"I pm glad to have a\nchance to assure you, although I am\nsure that Is not necessary, of the\nfriendly regard America has for the\nRussian people. It is important not to\nhave any musunderstandings at this\nserious moment. You decided to ter\nminate the war. What were the re\nsults? During the negotiations even\nGermany continued to send her troops\ninto Russia. What happened after\npeace? Germany continued to occupy\nRussian territories, humiliating Rus\nsia before the whole world. The Rus\nsian people must by now surely un- i\nderstand who are their friends and\nwho are their enemies. Russia knows\nthat she must fight again. We are\nhere among you, at the meeting oi\nvour soviet, to assure you that the\nallies are ready to help you. Be sure\nthat we are not going to leave you\nalone in this serious moment.\nGave Pledge for America.\n\"America has no land or naval forces\nat Mourman at the present mo\nment. If such forces come here, as\nyou request I assure you in the name\nof America that these forces will be\nbrought here only with the purpose\nof helping Russia remove the German\nmenace.\"\nThe statement of the French mili\ntary officer was of a similar nature.\nThe Mourman soviet voted unani\nmously to co-operate with the allied\nexpeditionary forces in the Mourman\nprovince and invited three allied of\nficials to become permanent members\nof the state soviet. The invitation\ncontemplated one Frenchman, one\nBritain and one American. I .heard\nthat the invitation had been accepted.\nThis plea for allied assistance was\nmade because of the threatening at\ntitude of the Finnish white guards,\nwho. although at that time they had\nnot crossed the frontier, were daily\nthreatening to do so. Subsequently\nthe Finns made two raids into Rus\nsian territory, the first on April 9, a\nfew days after British troops were\ndisembarked at Mourman, when a\nrailway bridge was destroyed and the\ntelegraph lines were cut at the 688th\nverst of the Mourman railway line. |\nThe second conflict occurred at Kem, j\na large town on the White sea which j\nwas first captured by the Finnish j\nwhite guards and later recaptured by\nthe soviet red guards.\nAt this time the central Moscow\nsoviet feared a general movement\nof Finnish-German troops toward\nMourman and perhaps Archangel as\nwell. They repeated their Invitation\nto the allies to land troops at Mour\nman to oppose the Germans should\nthey advance in that general direc\ntion.\nIn the Kola peninsula, in the east\nern part of Lapland, and in the Kem\ndistrict, north of Lake Ladoga, there\nare in all about 43,000 soviet red\nguard troops. At Mourman City there\nare perhaps 5,000 soviet red guard\ntroops.\nDeclaration of War Expected.\nA Stockholm dispatch, dated July j\n5, says: \"At editorial offices here a\ndeclaration of war by Finland against\nH-H' I M M ?!

The central soviet government\nat Moscow also urged the augmenta\ntion of the allied forces at Mourman.\nThe reported recent landing of Amer\nican forces in Mourman was possibly\nin response to that request. In the\nevent of the Finnish-German troops\nmoving against Mourman and Arch\nangel there will be opposed to them\nabout 50,000 troops or the soviet re\npublic and several thousand troops of\nthe allies.\nLast July a deputation of Finns\ncalled on Kerensky and arranged\nwith his minister of food supply to\nfurnish Finland with 100,000 tons of\nwheat. Finland is a non-agricultural\ncountry and always has been de\npendent on Imports for bread. Keren- !\nsky's government procrastinated and ;\nfailed to deliver the flour.\nThen came the October revoluton.\nwhich overthrew Kerensky and put\nthe soviet in power. The Finnish sen\nate asked the soviet government to\nmake' good Kerensky's promise of\nfood for Finland, calling the Soviet's\nattention to the fact that the wheat\nhad already been paid for. The soviet\nresponded that it could not feed\nPetrograd, let alone feed Finland.\nThe Finnish government finally de\nspaired of ever getting any grain out\nof the soviet government. It turned\nto the allies. A Dr. Ignatius, a justice\nof the Finnish supreme court, left;\nFinland for America via Stockholm. |\nPreviously he had negotiated in\nAmerica a hyge purchase of silver\nfor the Finnish mint. The Finnish\ngovernment then had a balance in\nNew York banks of something like\n$16,000,000. One single deposit was\n$9,000,000. Dr. Ignatius bought his\ngrain from a big American exporting\nhouse. He made arrangements with !\nthe Swedes to transport that grain\nacross Sweden partially by inland\nwaterways and partially by railway.\nHe then proceeded on to London to\narrange with the British for tonnage.\nPeople of Finland HungTy.\nSomehow or other Dr. Ignatius fail- :\ned to persuade the allied governments\nto feed Finland. Probably the allies\n! found it utterly impossible. Finland's\n3.250,000 people were hungry. There\nwas actual starvation in certain sec\ntions of the country. Finland kept\nfretting hungrier, and at last the\nFinnish senate had to admit that it\nwas having difficulties in getting\ngrain from the allies.\nThe Finnish government gave up all\nhopes of getting grain from the allies\nand began secret negotiations with\nGermany, although negotiations with\nthe allies continued. It was then a\nquestion of which would feed Finland.\nGermany or the allies, and Finland\nwould go with either side that offered\nher food.\nThe radical labor party, made up al- I\nmost wholly of workmen in the cities,\nformed a huge co-operative society in\nwhich all the labor unions Joined. The 1\nconservative and the socialist forces in\nFinland have for several elections been\nabout equal. First there would be a\nconservative speaker of the diet and he\nwould be succeeded by a socialist. The :\nI conflict in the diet was sharp, and since ?\n| the first days of the Russian revolution\na class feeling had been growing. This\nradical labor party was defeated at the\npolls in the midsummer elections. It\ncharged the conservatives with election\nfrauds. It then brought the conserva\ntive senate, which is the name of the\nFinnish cabinet, under Are for not being\nable to get food for Finland. In desper\nation the Finnish senate redoubled its\nefforts to obtain wheat from Germany.\nPromised Bussian Grain.\nIn the meantime representatives ef\nthe Finnish labor party had gone to !\nPetrograd to talk with the radical work\nmen elements of the soviet. The soviet i\nleaders whispered sweet nothings into\nthe ears of these Finnish radicals and\ntold them if they would overthrow their\nbourgeoise government, which was ne\ngotiating with the German government,\nthe enemy of all laborers, the soviet\nsrcvernment of Russia would furnish\nFinland with grain.\nThis promise sounded good to the Fin- i\nnish workmen. They immediately be- I\ngan to arm themselves, and following\nthe example of the Petrograd workmen\nthey overthrew their government.\nThe situation had different results. !\nhowever. In Finland nearly all of ;\nthe farmers were land owners. They\nheartily disapproved the methods of\nthe bolfheviki in Russia. When the\nlabor party had formed its army it\ncalled it the red guards. The govern\nment party formed its army and called\nit the white guards. Both sides wore\nhli\\0Ldrt8tir/Ul\"h,n8' rlbbon on their\neubltanU.nl VH The \"mle? ?\"?\n}Ji? fik'ffiS.SS a SSSB\nS&SS?

It\nof ers a striking contrast to the wild I\nstories and cotns,'ious misrepreiseunta\ntions upon which we have been fed\nby the daily pre:,s.--Rld.\nlBy JEROME DI)AVS.\nOn July 10, 1918, the fifth a!\nRussian cougress adopted a consti\ntution. Most of its provisions had\nbeen in ;actual operation for sonmei\ntime, although they had not been\nformallyv oeacted into the fundamen\ntal law. Representation is by oecu\npational rather than geographical\nunits. Even in the country districts\nthe peasants do not elect from a large\narea, such as our congressional dis\ni rict, but at a mass meeting of all the\ninlhabitants of each village or group\nof villages.\nI had been in Russia for nearly\nthree years. I had seen the czar's\nsystem at work for over a year and\nI knew it was not popular. Under\nthe Kerenslky regime I knew that the\nsoviet was the real power throughout\nRussia and was supported by a large\nmapority of the people. W\\Vhen Lenin\ntook power. I was acting in charge of\nall the Y. 1. ('. A. war work in Rus\nsia and was bitterly opposed to tlie\nBolsheviki. -lad I been a Russian I\nshould have fought them. I was op\nposed to them in J.uly and I aim op\nposed to themn now. Theiefore, with\nthe Bolsheviki in control, I determin-:\ned to find out how small a percentage\nof the Russian people really backed\ntheir soviets. ln the course of myi\nwork I had occasion to make a trip\nof over a month's duration down the\nVolga river. I decided to stop along:\nthe way to investigate the city and\nvillage soviets. With tlis purpose in\nview I prepared a list of 26 ques\ntions which I asked of soviet leaders.\nof the clergy, of business men, of\nteaichers; in short, of all classes of\ncitizens with whom 1 came in con\ntact. I shall give the results which\nwere in the m'ain agreed to by those\nI interviewed. Instead of presenting\na general summary. I shall take rep\nresentative places of different sizes.\nThe village of Sakolskoi, county of\nITakaraivskoi, is in the government of\nKlostro ma. 80 miles north of Nizhnit\nNovogorod on the Volga river'. The\nvillage \"Miir,\" or open meeting of the\ninhnhitants. has always existed. The I\nfirst time they organized and elected!\na soviet was in January, 1918. Since\nthen there had been but a single re\nelection, as no definite time had been\nset for one. The party of left social\nrevolutionists had been in control all\nthe time. The elections were hon\nes tly conducted and anyone had the\nright to vote. The voting took place\nin open meeting and was by upraised\nhand. t usally the priests and the\nlandlords stayed away because they\nfelt they would be hopelessly out\nvoted.l\nVOtelo.\nThe next higher soviet is the \"vo\nlost.\" or township of villages. Under\nthe constitution, each village is en\ntitled to send one delegate to the\nvolost for each 10 representatives in\nthe village soviet. It seemed to be\nthe real local administrative unit.\nThere were 54 villages or \"celos\" in\nthe volost of Sakolskoi and at firsta\neach village elected its own retire\nsentative. At the last election they\ndecided to try a new plan. Since aill\nthe villages were within a tenverst\n(a verst is two-thirds of a mile) ra\ndius of a center, they allowed any\nolle \\who wished to come to the volost\nelection. This resulted in an attend\nalice of 500. or an auerage of ab!out\ni0 voters front each village. As the\nvillages were small, this was not so\nhad an average as it would appoear.\nThe soviet had organized a librvary\nwith 3;.tti volumes besides many daily]\nnewspapers. It had charge of the dis-t\ntribution of the land and all agreedi\nthat it had divided fairly. The church i\nhad offered to loan two-thirds of its\nland to the soviet and the soviet had\naccepted, so that. the chburch still re-j\ntained one-third of its land and held\ntitle to all. The schools, formerly\nmlanaged by the church. were now\nunder the government. According to\nthe priest, all the orthodox ritual has\nbeen dropped, although they still per\nmitted him to teach the Bible. iHe\nsaid. \"The children are allowed to\ncome to tlie for further instruction\nafter school hours if they care to,\nbut tnone comile. The church has oth\nerwise Ielen unmlnolested. except that\nthle robber soviet takes the lnoney we\nused to collect from our rented build\nings.'\n1 visited another volost on June 6.\nIlere were 26 villages with a total\npopulation of 4,000 and an adult\npoiulation of about 2,01U0. All were\nwithi i a radius of six versts. They\nhad always had a village m\"lir,\" and\nwhen the soviiets began to be organ\nized it became the soviet. The elec\ntions were fairly conducted except\nthat the Iolshlieviki deceived the peo\nple with alluring promiises, accordinlg\nto thlie tstiimonily of the priest. Al\nthouigh every one. including the:\npriests and landlords, was allowed\nto \\ote, usually only the younger mllen\ntook aany inte rest in the electiolns.\nThe priest himself said, \"I could ibe\nelected if I could get enough leoplle\nto vote for me but I know it is hope\nless to expect thile peasants to do that.\nso I stay away.' Flections were held\nevery six months. At the last elec\ntion a bourgeois or propertied pea;\nant was elected head of the local sv\niet. Under the czar's regime he had\nbeen a leader in the zemtstvo and tih\nlocal governnment. -He was opposed\nto the Bolsheviki. but believed in the\nsoviets. The village which was the\nteautluarters to( Ltie volost had 12\nelected relpresentatives in its soviet,\nanid the lieo ple said they were hoiines\nand capable titen.\nF'romi1 the volost, delegates were uis\ntally senit to the Uyezd or counlty\nsovriit. I visited several of these\nailtl found them imuLCh the salntne as\nthe smaller units. In two cases ith\ntiiajority .f tie mlemblll s were' socjal\nrevolutionists and opposed to the\n-iolshieviki, but they had absolut.t ;at\nthority and freedom so far as local\n,affair,, were concernled. All classes\nof the pleol)le, from the liricests.o to t\nwealthy Iasants, seemed to be sati:\nfied that the delegates were true repi\nresentatives of the people The\ncharge which they continua!i; kept.\nmaking was that out.itle agitators\nwere being sent ini and dI-ceiving the\nPeasants by campaigln peeches. As\nwe are familiar with this in America:\nwe cannot condemn it very severely.\nDoubtless the people in Russia are\nmore ignorant and so more easily led.\nNevertheless, the pe.,sants have had\na little experience . ith politicians.\nUnder the czar's regime they were\nforced to elect propertied lmen for the\ndunla. The peasants elected those\nwho promised to vote for land reform\nand ladical measures. They then\ncollected funds of their own and sent\na peasant they couhl trust to Petro\ngrad to sit in the giallery of the duma\nand ,see whether the elected delegate\nvoted as he had promised.\nIn most of the counties, the soviets\nwere doing much to stimulate edu\ncation. In sonme cas(:s conmpulsory\nschool laws had been passed, and\neverywhere libraries were being\nopened at which newspapers, maga\nzines, and a few hooks could be read.\nThe paper which was always sure to\nbe in the library was the Isvestia, the\nofficial organ of the soviets. The\nhospitals were being kept up and\nthe medical staff incr'esed. although\ndrugs and e uIipnment were woefully\nshort.\nThe Gubernia or provincial soviet\nusually met in the cap.ital of the\nprovince. Thus the city of Nizhni\nNovogorod was the center for tihe\nprovince of the same name. During\nJlune, 1918, I ascertained the concen\nsus of representative opinion about\nthis Gubernia soviet. Theoretically,\n:the elections came every six months.\nSince the first revolt ion in April,\n1917, there had been two elections,\nand a third was in progress. The\nMensheviki were first in power, then\nbthe social revolutionists, and after\nthem the Bolsheviki. According to\nthe soviet leaders, every resident\nover 18 years of age could vote, in\ncluding capitalists, landlords, and\npriests. However. only that part of\nthe population which was organized\ntook part in the elections. There\nwere 12 counties in the province, and\nthe soviet had representatives from\nthem all. Nizhni Novogorod had one\nrepresentative on the central execu\ntire committee of the all-Russian con\ngress of soviets at Moscow. Most of\nithe residents with whom I talked\n(thought that the elections were per\nhaps conducted fairly. but that those\nI who wanted to agitate in favor of\nparties other than the i3olsheviki did\ninot have a fair opportltnily to do so\nin the city. It was generally admit\nted that the cihairmnan of the soviet\nand the great majority of the dele\ngates were honest although fanatical\nmen. The soviet had requisitioned\nwsome buildings belonging to the\nchurches, but, was using them for a\nschool for the war cripples. A uni\nversity was being oispeed by the Dol\nsheviki. The head professors seemed\nmost capabl menn. and were opposed\nto the lolshevikli. They offered Miss\nChilds, an American Y. W. C. A. sec\nretary, supervision of the courses in\ndomestic economy. and to provide her\n.wit h equipment.\nLet us now consider the city soviet,\ntli, backbone of the soviet power.\nTh,' constitution provides that in the\ncity there shall be one delegate for\nevery 1,000 inhabitants. Each organ\nized group of workers, whether of\nbrnin or hatnd. elects its own repre\nsentative to the city soviet. Thus\neach factory and shop elects its own\nrepreselltative. The doctors have a\nunion and elect their representative.\nThe lawyers also elect theirs, as do\nthe teachers. This extends down\nthrough all the various classes, so\nthat even the waiters, the cab drivers\nanti the housewives frequently organ\nize. .nufortunately, the small shop\nkeepers usually are unrepresented,\nheca use they do not form a union.\nOn a certain fixed day an election\n(cclurs. Each party has the right to\nnominate its own candidates. The\nballoting is by number. I visited one\nof the voting booths in a factory at\n1losco v on election day. Each party\nlhad 1a certain ilnumber; thus (I)\naiight be social revolutionists, (2)\nthe Biolshevists, (31 the Menshevists,\netc t On a shart hanlging up in tile\ne:l.ctiton room of the factory were the\nilnall(:: of thie parties with their prop\neor nalutbers. An election conimittee\nrepresenting every party was present,\nINd tl as elac-h man voted, his narue was\ncheikeid off. A man or woman voted\ntby -:iinply writiing the ninumber of the\npall; ihe supported on the ballot and\ndetljisiting it in a box.\nLet ;is take, as a concrete illustra\nI.ion, the city soviet of Kazan. I vis\nit ed the city in June, 1918. and in\ntel vi'wed business mhen, priests al(nd\nworkerlis. The headquarters of the\nsocial revolutionists were open. Pic\nt tur'-e of U1reshkovskayai, Kerensky\n111lIt other party leaders were hulng\nin Itth walls, and were for sale. I\nipilrc.has ed several of these, as well as\n\u2022 u..titical calendar bitterly attack\ning the B1olsheviki. The following\ntfart4 I quote fronm the representative\nof ti,. :;tocial revolutionist there; and\nbI.,lLse they were bitterly opposed\nto the IBolsheviki I take it that the\ne-vitlri!lce will at least not bl over\ndran n in tlheir favor. The unit for\nti.c tions amnong the workers is the\nf;citory. as distinguished fromnt the\ntrlade. All the working classes, from\nthe newsboys to the waiters, have\ntheir organizations, and all send\n;heir rte reeentatives to the soviet.\nThe c, nly people who have so far not\ndone so are the cab drivers and the\nwives. They have not been interest\n-id enough to form organizations, but\nuniloubtl dly will do so. Thle elect\n!i's- are fairly conducted, hbut the\n<ociat! revolutiollist party is inot al\nlowiied to send its pa;per directly to\ni!t t- factory as the Ilolsheviki do; we\nc:an hiave it sent-to the work:er's honrle\nbut thiat costs money. I'rlu:lestion\n:iabi the overwhelmting nan;ber in tilt\n\"ity are now in favor of the Bto!she\nviki, but they are deceived by glow\ning promises and will sometime Ih\ndisillusioned. F Frotm all the testi\ntmony I could gather frowm business\nIiinti and priests, the leaders in tile\nsoviet were sillncelre menl whlo we!re\ntrying to do constructive things\nThey always treated our Y. M1. C. A\nreopresentative fairly andi he remained\nill Kazan until the (zechs had cap\ntured the city and It had bhre retak\n,m by the soviet forces, lie says the\n,etople were glad to have the sovi tr\n'ia-k.\nIAbove the city and provincial iov\n\u2022 B IL IS WANTED\nWITHOUT FOR THE\nMEN WHO ARE IN JAIL\nHundreds of workers are literally rotting in the jails of this country\nbecause of their activity in the cause of Labor. Many of these vitiims\nof the worldi-wide class war are awating trial-and have been waiting\nfor mainy weary months for the speedy trial guaranteed them by the\nUnited States Constitution. Others were tried and sentenced to terms\nruanging from one to twenty years during the period of war hysteria,\nand appeals in their cases are now being taken from King Capital drunk\nto Kin g Capital sober.\nSonme of the prisoners have escaped by death, others are dying, many\nhave contralted tuberculosis and other loathsome diseases, and all are\nsufferiing untold agoniy from close con finement in the fetid atmosphere,\nfromn insanitary and unhealthy surroundings, from poor and insufficient\nfood, and from inihuman treatrent accorded them by brultalized guards.\nPast attempts to secure bail for all of these workers in jail have not\nbeen attended with great success because of the lack of system. In\ndividuals soughlt to secure bail for their person;tl friends, and failing to\nget the necessary amount they returned what had been collected, thus\nmaking their entire efforts fruitless. This was the condition facing the\ndelegaules from all the western district organiiations of the Industrial\n\\WVorkers of the W orld when the, met in conference on July 3 and 4 in\nSeattle. The delegates solved the problem by an unfailing means\nOrgaiization.\nA Buil and Bond Committee was elected to systematize the work of\ncollectig bauil and a nation-wide drive has been started to secure the\nloan olf cash, Liberty Bonds and property sufficient to gain the release\nof all class war prisoners. With practically no advertising Six Thou\nsand Ilollars were raised in the first five days. More than Two Ilun\ndried l'housand Dollars are needed to release those now being held for\ntheir Labor activity.\nSums of Five Dollars and up are accepted as loans, and all cash, Lib\nerty Bouds or proplerty is tabulated in triplicate, ine copy going to the\nperson making tih la; Il, another being retained by the hail and Bond\nCommittee, andl th th irl being filed with the T'l'des Union Savings\nand Loan Association of Seattle, with whom all funds, bonds and prop\nerlty schedules will be banked.\nO)ily those who have been proved loyal and trustworthy are being\nsenti out as collectors. Everything possible has beent done to safeguard\nIhis bail and bonid fund, from the selection of the committee to the\nclhonice of the batik. A portion of1 the fund is being set aside to return\nloans on demand in case persons who have made them are forced to\nleave the country or have other reasons for making a withdrawal.\nBail will be used to release specified persons where that is desired,\nlibut otherwise the release will take place by a blind drawing of na.mes,\nthus insuirin fairness to all prisoners. By common consent the men\nin Wichita, Kansas. jail will first be released, as they have been held\nthe longest and jail conditions are worse there than anywhere else in\nthe entire country. This bail has nearly all been subscribed, and the\nmener will lie made accredited collectors when released, and their speedy\nrelease will help In set others at liberty.\nNo necessity exists for argument. Your duty is clear. If your ears\nare not deauf to a call from yaour class, if yon feel that an injury to one\nis an injury to all, if there burns within you the faintlest spark of human\nity, yn will see thait the men do not remain behind the bars an un\nnecessary minute because you withheld your support.\nTHEY ARE WILLING TO GIVE THEIR LIVES FOR YOU!\nARE YOU WILLING TO LOAN YOUR DOLLARS TO THEM?\nSend all cash, checks and bonds to John L.

The all\nRussian congress meets every six\nmonths, or oftener on special call.\nSince the Bolshevihi have been in\npower there have been six' or about\none congress every four months. The\npast year has been, of course, unpre\ncedented. The Bolsheviki have had\nto form the entire government, try to\nput all their socialistic principles in\npractice, and construct a political ma\nchine that would function. In order\nto understand how such a congress\nworks, we shall take the proceedings\nof the fourth extraordinary congress\nof the council of the workmen's, sol\ndiers', peasants' and Cossacks' depu\nties. My facts in regard to this\ncongress ale taken from personal ob\nservalion and fromi the official record\nof the translated stenographic pro\nceedings made by the American con\nsaln general, a copy of which is now\nin my possession. When this con\ngress opened there were 1,084 dele\ngantes with a deciding vote and 80\ndelegates with a consulting vote.\nThey belonged to the different par\nlies au; follows: Holsheviks, 732;\nleft social revolutionists, 238; anar\nchists, 14; unionists, 24; social dem\nocrat internationalists. 16; social\ndeimocrait 17kraines. ;; nonpartisan,\n18; social revolutionists center, 15;\nsocial revolutionists Maximalists. 24.\n< oi. lRaymond Robins, commander of\nthe American Red Cross in Russia,\nhad in his possession for 18 hours,\n1,184 credentials of the delegates to\nthis congress. In sonie instances\nt here were three credential. from\nthree villages behind one delegate.\nThese credentials were submitted to\na titled Russian on the one hand and\na Menslievik Russian on the other,\nand Mr. Robins had their statement\nthat to the best of their knowledge\nand belief they were authentic. The\ncredentials came from soviets as far\neast as Vladivostok, as far wdst as\nSmolensk, as far north as Murmansk,\nand as far south as Odessa. This\ncongress, therefore, really did repro\n:,ent a majority of the people.\nOn opening, the congress immedi\nately elected a mandate commission\ncomposed of one member for every\n1It0 delegates,. but factions having\n20 or more were also entitled to a\n.cloeseutattve. This mandate com\nmission had the task of considering\nall credentials and seating delegates.\n'When the congress closed it had\nseated 1.198 members. Tie congress\nwas only in session three days. March\n14, 15 and 16. On the whole it was\n:inductedl with fairness to all par\nties, as far as I could judge. Be\nfore it disbanded a permanent execu\ntive conmnittee of 200 members was\nelected which remained in office un\ntil the next all-Russian congress\nelected their successors. For every\nsix delegates there was one member\non the executive committee. Each\nparty. according to its strength, was\nallowed to place the representatives\nit ,desired on this committee. This\nexecutive committee is the real power\nin the soviet governments and elects\nor dismisses the people's commissars\nat will.\nIt must always he remeinbered\nthat the Botshekiki are merely one\n1 party, Ibut that the soviets are a form\nof government. Although I was bit\nterly opposed to the Bolsheviki. I\nbhecame convinced, after a detailed\nstudy of the soviets and their organ\nization, that they did represent the\n- Russian people. After the German\n- ambassador had been killed and the\nileft social revolutionists imprisoned,\nit was perhaps true that the majority\nI of the people were opposed to the\nBolsheviki, but even then they be\nlieved in the soviets. Since that time\nthe Bolsheviki may have gained pop\nularity. Because of my e}Kperience I\ncan well understand how Isaac Dou\n1 Levine, who left America bitterly op\nposed to the Bolsheviki, should now\nwire fiomn Moscow, \"Never in the his\ntory of modern Russia has any gov\ne rnmuent had more real authority\nthan the soviet systeml. Even the\nI blind observer here quickly sees that\na formidable majority of the nation\nfavors the soviet government.\"\nBOILERDMAERS LOCKED\nOUT IN PENNSY1VANIA\ntYork I a. -- Boilermakers em\nploved by the Steacy-Schmidt com\npany were locked out when they\nasked for 71 cents an hour.

The labor unions\ncannot and will not stand aside from those ma?\nnificient problems which are now attracting the\nattentim of the entire world, and which divide all\nhumanity into two camps of white and red. Every\nunion is now compelled to take an interest in the\nquestions of mobilization, demobilization, indirect\nand direct taxation, of the payment of war debts,\nof nationalization of railroads, mines, important\nindustries, etc. With each day, to any member\nin the ranks of the labor unions, it will become\nclearer and clearer that neutrality propagated to\nthe labor unions by the bourgeoisie and opportun\nists is a common bourgeois trick; that in the de\ncisive grappling of the two classes one cannot be\nneither warm nor cold.\nDivision in the ranks of the labor unions ha\nbegun.

Through their long tested servants,\nthrough the old leaders of the labor movement,\nit is attempting, again to take these unions into\nits hands. In Amsterdam, as you know, was held\na convention which declared itself the international\ngathering of labor unions. Legien, Jouhaux, Gom\npers, and other bourgeois agents attempted to\ndirect the flow of the labor movement along the\nold channel. The much talked of League of Na\ntions, which is in reality a confederation of im\nperialistic robbers, convoked in Washington, and\nafterwards at Paris, a ludicrous convention for\n\"the international protection of labor\": having\napportioned two-thirds of the votes to the bourg\neoisie and one-third to the bourgeois agents such\nas Legien, Jouxhaux and company, who call them\nselves \"labor representatives\"!\nAt these conferences, packed by the bourge\noisie, they are attempting to put a straight-jacket\nupon the labor movement which is awakening to\nnew life! It is intended by the joint efforts of\nbourgeois ministers and the bureaucrats of the\nlabor union movement again to place the labor\nunions upon the Procrustean bed of bourgeois re\nformism!

Russia. He asserts in several interviews that he\nwas permitted to arrive in Russia on condition that he\nleave political matters alone. There has been no such\nrestriction placed upon him since his return to the\nUnited States, for he appears as an open advocate of\nfull trade relations with the Soviet Government of\nRussia. m\nThe Chicago lriDunc tnus quotes mm:\n\" 'We must leave Russia alone' he said in\nsummarizing his views. 'We should resume\ntrade with the Soviet. The Bolshevist Govern\nment is permanent While there are only\n700,000 members of the Communist party, the\npeasants, who represent almost 100,000,000 peo\nple, are solidly back of the Lenin regime.'\"\nAmong the Soviet devices which the 100,000,000\npeasants of Russia are said to be \"solidly baek of,\" is\nthe following (it is particularly interesting in view of\nthe fact that Judge Fisher is judge of the Morals\nCourt of Chicago) :\n\" 'Some time ago it was published that the\nwomen of Russia had become national prop\nerty,' he said. 'That is untrue, but the ease\nwith which marriage and divorce may be effected\nmakes for rapid changes. Everyone wanting to\nmarry goes to what we would call the city hall\nand registers.\n' Inducements to marry are great. When peo\nple are hard pressed for clothes and food they\nsometimes make a pact to wed for a day.\n\" 'The next day they go down to the city hall\nand register again. This time their names are\nput side by side in the divorce book. That is all\nthat is necessary to be divorced, and they have\nhad a good feed in the bargain.' \"\nJudge Harry Fisher, of Chicago, who has returned\nfrom Jewish relief work abroad, evidently is one with\nthe others in not being ashamed of Trotsky.\nAlso Max Pine, for many years secretary of the\nUnited Hebrew Trades of New York, has been abroad\nin Soviet Russia as \"a labor delegate.\" He too had\nmany good things to say of the Soviets, among other\nthings the strange contradiction that the Jews are do\ning very well in Russia but are not pro-Bolshevik 1\nHere are three persons from widely different\nspheres of life, yet each one of them indicates a nat\nural liking for the Kahal or Soviet, an admiration\nof its methods, and a distinct good feeling toward its\nrulers. For Sovietism is the rankest form of autoc\nracy, and the marriage laws of Soviet Russia are in\nfull harmony with the program stated in the Protocols\n\"We will break down the influence of family\nlife among the Gentiles.\"\nWhether the Soviet-Kahals of Russia will succeed\nin completely undermining Russian family life is ex\ntremely doubtful. The weakness of Soviet rule is the\nsame as that of the Protocols a moral weakness which\nmust eat like a cancer until it destroys the institutions\nwhich it infests.\nRussia today, viewed in the light of the Protocols,\ndoes not represent the Judaic state, but it represents\nthe Gentile state seized by Jewish forces. There are\nthree degrees of action set forth in the Protocols.\nThere is first the secret process of breaking up the in\ntegrity of society by the admixture of alluring but dis\nruptive ideas. This is a work in which Gentile agi\ntators are used. When the ideas have worked suf\nficiently to break up society and explode in a crisis,\nthen as in Germany, the forces that have worked in\nsecret come swiftly to the front to take the reins and\nguide the riot. In Germany this immediately occurred\nupon the collapse which followed the armistice, but the\nGermans were wise enough to know the meaning of the\ninflux of Jews into all the official positions of the\nformer empire, and it was not long before they were\npolitically ousted. In Russia, however, the Jews sprang\nimmediately into official positions and have succeeded\nin remaining there. It began with Kerensky com\npelling the Czar to lay aside his crown; it continues\nwith Trotsky and his armies at the throat of Europe.\nBut this seizure of a country, as was attempted in\nGermany, and as was not only attempted but succeeded\nin Russia, is not the end of the Program. It is only\nthe beginning of its open or public phase. The Soviet\nKahal makes for the complete breaking up of society,\nthe entire cutting off of co-operation and communica\ntion, the ruling of each little section in the way de\nsired, until the whole country lies helpless in isolated\nbits. The process includes, of course, the disintegra\ntion of industry also, the massing of Gentiles into an\narmy, and a general destruction of morality and order.\nIt is the Protocol program in it last stage before the\nreconstruction begins which shall make the conquered\ncountry a Jewish state.\nThe world has not seen that last stage yet. It has\nnot come, even in Russia. If the Russian people waken\nfrom the daze into which they have been thrust, it will\nnot come. Jewish voices loudly proclaim that Soviet\nRussia has come to stay. The only authoritative voice\non that subject is the voice of Russia, and Russia has\nriot yet spoken. Today the world is trembling on the\nvery verge of Real Russia's awakening, and with it a\nretribution most terrible upon the Sovietists.\nThe program of the Protocols once came near suc\nceeding in the French Revolution, but its essential im\nmorality overreached itself. It has come a step nearer\nsuccess in Russia, but there too its defiance of the\nmoral law will be its undoing. The Jewish Question\nof today is being fought out in Russia and Poland, and\nthe strength of the Jewish forces is largely and mostly\nsupplied from the United States of America. No won\nder those small East European independencies which\nare fighting for their lives refer to our country as\n\"The Land of the Jews.\"\n\"We will show our power to one,\" says the\nProtocols. \"In order to demonstrate our enslave\nment of the Gentile governments of Europe, we\nshall show our power to one of them by crimes\nof violence, that is, by a reign of terror.\" (Proto\ncol Seven)\nOne by one the Gentile nations of Europe have\nbeen compelled to withdraw their troops from Russia.\nOne by one the premiers of Europe have submitted to\nheavy shackling of their official hands with regard to\nthe Russian question. And today the world looks on\nwhile little Poland, apparently the second country on\nthe list of Soviet victims, is made to feel heavy venge\nance for her daring to be independent of Jewish power.\nRussia has been made to pay for her attempted inde\npendence of the Jew; Poland is now being made to\npay. It is a flame, the Jews of Eastern Europe nope,\nand many Jews of America also, which will sweep\nround the world. .\nIf the ruling Jews of the world wished the Russian\npeople freed, if they wished the flames of Bolshevism\nto be quenched, if they wished Jewish participation in\nrevolutionary movements to be withdrawn, they could\naccomplish it in a week. What is going on today is\ngoing on by permission of the Jewish world powers.\nThere is apparently no desire to curtail a movement\nwhich largely originated in American Jewry. This is\nthe program of \"showing our power to one,\" and the\nprogram will be followed out. The \"showing\" how\never is twofold; it is a showing of power, but it is also\na showing of the people who wield the power, and in\nthe end it might have been just as well had the powei\nnever been coveted, attained, or used.\nAnyone who desires to test the exactitude of the\nProtocols' estimate of human nature may do so by ob\nserving his own reactions to the Russian Bolshevist\nsituation. It is undeniable that there exists among all\nclasses of Gentiles in America a kind of admiration for\nthe coup which Lenin and Trotsky have managed on\nsuch a massive scale. The audacity of it, the ability\nto stay afloat thus long in defiance of so many laws,\nhave conspired to draw out unwilling applause.\nConsider then this passage from the Tenth Protocol:\n\"The people feel an especial love and respect\ntoward the genius who wields political power,\nand they say of all his high-handed actions : Tt\nis base, but clever! It is a trick, but how he\nplayed it! So majestic! So impudent!'\n\"We count on attracting all nations to the\nconstructive work of laying the foundations for\nthe structure planned by us. It is necessary for\nus first of all to acquire the services of bold and\nfearless agents, who will overcome all obstacles\nin our pathway.\n\"WThen we accomplish our governmental coup\nd'etat, we will say to the people: 'Everything has\ngone badly, all have suffered. We will eliminate\nthe causes of your sufferings nationality, fron\ntiers and diversity of coinage. Of course you\nare free to pronounce sentence upon us, but that\ncan scarcely be just if you do so before giving\na trial to that which we offer you.' \"\nThis is very well conceived, and this is the way in\nwhich, up to this time, it has worked out. But there\nwill be a strong reaction set in. False promises like\nchickens come home to roost. The real originators,\nthe real purpose of the movement hidden behind Bol\nshevism will become evident. And then the world will\ncrush out again the World Program which at times\nhas seemed so near success.\nThere will probably be more light upon this World\nProgram as a result of the Russian Kahal-Soviet\nsystem than from any other attempt to realize it. For\nfive generations the world has lived in a false light\nsupposed to be shed by the French Revolution. It is\nnow known that that revolution was not the Revolu\ntion of the French People, but the disorders of a mi\nnority who sought to impose upon the French People\nthe very Plan which is now being considered. It was\nthe French People who ultimately put down the so\ncalled French Revolution. And France, as a result of\nthat upheaval of a well-organized minority, has been\nbound by Jewish control ever since.\nThe Russian Revolution will go down in history\nwith no such false halo of romance around it. The\nworld now knows it for what it is. The world will\nsoon know whose was the money and whose were the\nbrains that fostered it, and from what part of the\nworld the principal impetus came. The Russian up\nheaval is racial, not political nor economic. It conceals\nbeneath all its false socialism and its empty mouthings\nof \"human brotherhood\" a clear-cut plan of racial\nimperialism, which is not Russian, and which the com\nmon sense and interest of the world will speeddy\nstamp out.\nA booklet containing the first nine\n.i.i.. n, I r -ill k. - m \" \" 10 '\" \"d\nThree Ships of Success\nTHE storv is told that .it the naval academy at Annapolis, on one oc\n1 casion, the question was asked in an examination. \"GlW as bnelly as\npossible the reason for the defeat oi the Spanish Arma.la.\nOne of the cadets wrote his answer in fourteen words :\n\"The defeat was caucd by the Spaniard's lack of three sh.ps-Sca-manship,\nMarksmanship, Leadership.\" -tmifA\nThere has been many a man whose success m life has been wrecked\nby the lack of one. or all. of three ships:\nWorkmanship Friendship Generalship.\nWorkmanship : There are a lot of men who do OO, to jriteta\ntheir work.

The published compen:iun.\nis by no means a conclusive report on\npresent conditions in Soviet Russia, but is\npreparatory to it.

The prelim- il\ninary report now under review is a result of\nthat research. Its impartial character is y\nabove question. The summary written by C\nMr. Thomas is particularly significant, com- ?\ning, as It does, from so well known a cham- ^\nplon of advanced Socialism. The publication, jr\nmoreover, is timely. It is given to the world ts\nat the psychological moment when the proletariat\nof Italy and other countries seem to \"\nbe yielding more and more to the specious ]|\nlure of Russian Soviet theories. f;\nCommenting upon the task of Dr. Pardo P\nand his associates, who collected this voluminous\ndocumentary information, Albert 9\nThomas writes: ti\n\"Our collaborators have put together and a\nclassified particulars from the various scattared\ndocuments which were likely more or ,|\nless to satisfy our desire for information, u\nTheir first few weeks' researches and pre- d\nUminary critical work led them to frame a ^\nseries of fresh questions which, by their tj\nV ?n TT.

Soviet establishments\nand officials breaking the stated rules\nof labor distribution are guilty of official\ncrime.\"\nDespite the compulsory labor ideal, the\nRussian Commissary of Labor reported in\nJune, 1918, that the number of unemployed\npersons was in excess of 300,000. The Bolshevists\ndevised an elaborate system of\nrelief funds for the unemployed, the former\nemploying classes, of course, being mulcted\nfor the maintenance of the fund. A. Anlkst,\nchief of the Labor Market section of the\nCommissariat of Labor, is quoted as having\nmade in one of his official bulletins a naive\nexplanation of the non-acceptance of regular\nemployment. \"The unemployed,\" says the\nchief of section, \"receive 5 to 7 rubles and\nmeals; seeing that they can earn secretly\n35 ruble* more, there is no reason why they\nshould take work paid at 13 to 15 rubles a\nday.\"\nThe New Autocrat*.\nLenine and Trotzky have followed the\nnationalization of Industry with its logical\nsequence?the militarization Of labor. Free,\nlabor, if such a thing ever existed in Russia\nIs now only a memory. The Soviet rulers\nare tho new autocrats. Trotzky, addressing\nthe Central Revolutionary Executive Committee.\nlast February, said:\n\"The Soviet Republic will not allow Itself\nto be affected by the grievances of thoso\nwho are plunged in liberal and bourgeois\nprejudices; liberty of the labor of the exploiter\nIs the ruin of the State.

So\ncalled privato bankers, brokers and\nexchange dealers In other States have\nvirtually been given a Federal license\nto sell to Russians and Russian Jews\nhere paper money that has practically\nno valuo In the country whore It Is\nprinted.\nThe Comptroller ,of the Treasury\nhas been Informed that, according\ntc statements made to The Evening\nWorld by persons familiar with the\nInside of tho astonishing field of graft\nopened up by the Federal Govern\nment, the real object of the persons\nwho procured the ruling of the Treas\nury and Stato Departments was not\nto aid American commerce. Their\npurpose, this newspaper is told. Is\ntwofold:\nFirst To aid ths 8ovIet Gov\nernment with Amtrjea'n money.\n' 8eond To make exorbitant\nprofits by salting paper rubles\nor sxchangs based on paper ru\nbles to millions of Russians and\nRussian Jews In this country\nare aetually throbbing with anx\nIsty to aid starving, freezing rel\natives and friends In Russia. t\nThe Evening World Is told that an\nInvestigation by tho Treasury De\npartment, vigorously conducted,\nwould probably establish that tho\nSoviet Government of Russia which\nthis Government does not recognize\nreally responsible for the removal\nof restrictions on trading In Soviet\nrubles. Beyond any doubt certain\norganizations which are now aotlve\nIn preparation for dealing In Soviet\nrubles are In sympathy with the\nI Soviet Government anil the Treasury\nI Department, with lti powers of ln\nplans are under way to raise, under\ncamouflage, a vast sum of American\nmoney to be forwarded, under camou\nflage, to Lenlne rind Trotsky.\nAs to the supposed Interests of\nAmerican commerce which are to' be\nserved by recognition of the money\nof a government whloh is not recog\nnized by the United States as a Gov\nernment, The Evening World has. as\nauthority that such Interests cannot\nbe served, the leading financial insti\ntutions, of New York. It Is only nec\nessary to quote the following from\nthe financial columns of the Now\nYork Tribune to show that the order\nof the Federal Reserve Bank, Issued\nby nod with tho authority of tho\nTreasury and Btate Departments, Is\nof no effect In respect of American\ncommerce- or American finance The\nTribune says:\n\"Removal of the Treasury Depart-'\nmcnt's ban upon dealings In Russian\nexchange resulted In no change In tho\nstatus of Russian rubleH In this\nmarket Exchange brokers said that\nconditions In Russia were so chaotic\nthat It would bo Impossible to deal In\nRumlan exchango bills.

Copjrlytit. 1821.\nRIGA, Latvia, November 12.?Alex\nantler Krasnoschokov, formerpresl\ndent of the Far Eastern Republic and\nknown during several 3 ears of resi\ndence in Chicago as A. Stroller'Rob\ninson, has entered upon bis duties as\nassistant comnfisar of finance in the\nsoviet government at Moscow. In\nconnection with statements in Parts\nnewspapers that further financial\nchanges' must .be made ih Russia be\nfore any sort of recognition ot the\nsoviet government is possible, the ap\npointment of KrasnoscholtQv takes on\na new interest. Until recently 'lie\nguided the Far Eastern Republic, ob\ntained the passage of a law .legaliz\ning gold as currency, and gold and\nsilver are now said to be in general\ncirculatibn there. The government\nand the railroads accept payment\nonly in gold or silver, thus insuring\na real income to the government.\nFar East Ta* System.\nThe Far Eastern Republic never had\nsuch a food tax as is -collected* in\nRussia, but had food or money taxes,\nthe peasants being permitted to'pay\ntheir taxes in money and keep their\ngrain. Under the Chita government\nthe population has no right to refuse\npaper mflTiey in ordina-y internal\ntrade, but there is no stable relation\nbetween gold and silver coins and the\npaper currency. The change to a\ntrold basis immediately stimulated\nt.ie imports and exports of the coun\ntry.\nIn Moscow the circulation of gold is\nentirely illegal. This week the state\nbank fixed the value of a gold ruble\nat 43,000 rubles in the paper money.\nIn illegal trade in the markets, how\never. the gold ruble is worth 60,000\npaper rubles. It Is impossible to fore\ncast the speed of the finane'al re\norganization of soviet Russia orjhow\nfar it will go. It is impossible to\nforetell either whether the food tax\nprinciple will be changed before next\nyear.\nSoviet Coagnaa Called. ....\nAn all-Russian congress of sovlets\nhas been called for December 20.\nThere tho new financial phase of the\n^present econom c policy of the gov\nernment is bound to be presented. In\nspeeches this week before the Mos\ncow communists the failure of the\nsystem of barter in Russia has been\nhinted at.

In addition to passing\nresolutions favoring the immediate release of all\n.political prisoners and denouncing the blockade of\nRussia, endorsement was given to the co-operative\nmovement and steps were.taken for the forma\ntion o'f a womens' auxiliary. ,\nThe delegates, without exception, were on the\njob all the time during the seven days of the con\nvention. Rollcalls disclosed no absentees. In fact, it\nwould be difficult to find a more alert and con\nscientious body of workers than those in attend\nance at the Auto Workers' Convention.\nA proposal for the transfer or interchange of\nmembership cards between the Auto Woi'kers and\nother unions was carried unanimously. This action,\nas some of the delegates pointed out, was a demon\nstration of the kind of solidarity that an industrial\nunion believes in.\nMove to Unite Independent Unions.\nOne of the steps taken by the tonvention which\nmay become historic, was the selection of a com\nmittee to bring about, if possible, closer relations\nwith the large and growing number of independ\nent unions in the United States. The discussions\nindicated that the auto workers are keenly alive to\nthe important part being played in the labor move\nment by the Amalgamated Clothing Workers, the\nYardmen's Union, the Brotherhood of Metal Work\ners, the Millinery Workers, and other organiza\ntions. By a large majority the delegates favored the\nremoval of the general headquarters of the organ\nization from Chicago to Detroit.\nOfficers elected were the following: President,\nWm. A. Logan ; vice-president, Hal Richards ; sec.\ntreasurer, Chas. H. Dickerson; members of the\ngeneral executive board, Wm. Meyers o Mil\nwaukee, C. A. Dickman of Cincinnati, Wm. H.\nWendell of Toledo, A. E. Rohan of New York, and\nFrank Majchrzak of Grand Rapids. Five resident\nmembers of the board will be elected later by the\nDetroit local.\nThe Shop Committees:\nPresident W. A. Logan's report reviewed the re\nmarkable development the organization has had\nin the past two years. The greatest step forward,\nhe said, has been taken -in Detroit where the shop\nunit or group system is working., successfully.\nThere is one committeeman for every 10 workers\nemployed. These committees comprise what is\nknown as the board of administration which is the\ngoverning body of the local. The Auto Workers\nunion was the' first labor organization in thi3\ncountry to adopt this plan. Other cities are adopt\ning it with some modifications.\nIn the reports of the general president, the or\nganizers and in the convention debates, the fact\nwas emphasized many times that the United Auto\nmobile, Aircraft & Vehicle Workers of America\nowes much of its strength and rapid growth to\neducational methods which in some respects have\nbeen original and striking. Action was taken to\nextend work along this line by a further develop\nment of the union's literature. The provision to\nincrease the percapita tax so as to make it possible\nfor every member to be placed upon the mailing\nlist of the Auto Worker, the official journal'of the\norganization, carried unanimously.\nResolution On Russia\nOne of the gratifying actions of the delegates\nwas the stand taken in favor of Soviet Russia\nwhen the following resolution was passed:\n' Whereas the people of the United States enter\ned the late waifor the principle of democracy\nand self-determination for the people of all na\ntions, and\nWhereas, economic pressure and a blockade\nis instigated by the Allied powers, of which our\ngovernment is a part, against Soviet Russia, and\nWhereas, such action is unjust, and is cau\nsing much hardship to the Russian people, es\npecially the women and children; therefore, be it\nResolved, that we, the United Automobile,\nAircraft and Vehicle Workers of America, in con\nvention assembled, wish to voice our protest\nagainst our government taking part in such block\nade or supporting such other nation or nations,\nwhich at the present time are waging an unjust\nwar against Soviet Russia."}, "76": {"url": "https://chroniclingamerica.loc.gov/lccn/sn88078683/1920-12-04/ed-1/seq-12.json", "date": "19201204", "ocr_eng": "f\nPAGE 12\nTHE TOILER\nSATURDAY.

This scale is to be supplemented when\ndetails are worked out, little has been done for\nprotection of labor. This is explained by the fact\nthat the union has only existed a short time; it\nwas therefore not only impossible to introduce\nradical measures for the protection of labor but\nalso to study this question in order to find a n\ntional solution of the various problems, on the\nother hand, the union was prevented from carry\ning out this work by the extraordinary conditions\nwhich prevailed, when the whole attention of\nthe Republic was concentrated on the struggle\nwith the White Guards who were supported by\ntne Allies.\nThe greatest achievement of the unions was the\norganization of the Fostitate of agricultural labor,\nwhich is functioning now in most of the Govern\nments. The immediate tasks which the union is\nendeavoring to achieve in the sphere of protection\nof labor are: the regulation of food supplies, im\nprovement of- housing conditions, seeing to the\nobservations of the Iabor Laws in Agriculture,\nthe introduction of normal working day, the aboli\ntion of child labor, up to the age of 14, the reduc\ntion of working day for young persons under 18.\nThe carrying on of educational work was even\nmore difficult than work in connection with the\nprotection of labor. The lack of trained workers\nwas severely felt, so also was the scarcity of\nnecessary appliances and literature which would\nanswer the demand of the moment.\nRecently however work in this direction is being\nconducted more smoothly.

They named the new nation\nthe \u201cRussian Socialist Federal Soviet\nRepublic.\u201d They hung out a flag, a\nred cloth, in the left corner of which\n(on top, near the pole) are in golden\nletters \u201cR. S. F. S. R.\u201d The coat of\narms of the new Russian government\nconsists of a scarlet background on\nwhich a golden scythe and a hammer\nare placed (crosswise, handles down\nward) in sun rays and surrounded by\na wreath, inscribed: \u201cRussian Social\nist Federal Soviet Republic. Workers\nof the World, Unite.\u201d\nThe constitution of a country is its\nfoundation. It must be solid and\nstrong if liberty is to be secure. The\nwhole superstructure depends upon\nthe foundation. Government is a\nhouse made of laws. You cannot have\npeace, freedom and order without law.\nThe people who live in the house, the\ngreat national family, have a vital in\nterest in the house in which they live.\nIt is their shelter, their security. It is\nthe right of every free man to have\na say in the kind of house he is to\nlive in, a voice in the making of the\nlaws he is called upon to obey and\nmaintain. The house of Freedom is\none citizen\u2019s house as much as it is\nanother's. Without equality then 1\ncannot be freedom. Every Russian\nhad an equal right to determine the\nkind of government that should pre\nvail in his hind. The bolshevik gov\nernment started off by denying the\npeople the right to a say in the form\nof government of their country. A\nminority, without consulting the people,\nwithout giving them a chance to ex\npress their views, forced upon the\npeople a constitution. So the bolshe\nvik government was built on the false\nfoundation of minority rule. The prin\nciple that all governments derive their\njust powers from the consent of the\ngoverned was sent to the scrap heap.\nGovernment by Soviets.\nThe Russian constitution provides\nfor a government of soviets. The word\nsoviet means council. The soviet is\na body of political officeholders who\nrun the government. In our country,\nInstead of calling these bodies soviets,\nwe call them township commissioners,\nvillage trustees, city councils or\nboards of aldermen, state legislatures,\ncongress. Under the bolshevik consti\ntution all power is given to the so\nviets. This is and has been the rally\ning cry of the members of the soviets.\nThe soviets have the power to make\nlaws as well as the power to enforce\nobedience to the laws. The legislative\nand executive power is combined in\nthe soviet.\nThe bolshevik constitution divides\nRussia into regions, provinces, coun\nties, towns, villages, rural districts\nand local rural districts. For the sake\nof comparison we can liken Russia\nto the United States, a province in\nRussia to a state in our Union, and so\non down through the list. We have no\npolitical division corresponding to the\nRussian region, a unit larger than an\nAmerican state.\nThe Russian citizen\u2019s liberty is\nmeasured by the voice he is given in\nselecting the men who are to make\nthe laws he must obey. The constitu\ntion fixes his freedom. It says how\nfar he may go and no farther.\nWe have heard much about the\n\u201cpoor peasants.\u201d The constitution\nmakes them paupers in liberty. Down\nat the bottom of government the\nfarmer, the \u201cpoor peasant,\u201d is given\nthe right to vote for delegates to the\nlocal rural soviet. This little body has\nabout the same power in shaping the\npolicy of Russia and making the laws\nthat affect life, liberty and property\nas the township commissioners have\nIn the United States. Their authority\nis confined to purely local matters.\nWhen the \u201cpoor peasant\u201d has cast this\none lonesome and meaningless vote\nfor a representative in the local rural\nsoviet he is through so far as any di\nrect say in who shall govern him, and\nhow.\nGoverned by Officeholders,\nThe \u201cpoor peasant,\u201d having cast his\nvote for the local rural soviet, leaves\nthe task of government to the office\nholders. The deputies elected to the\nlocal rural soviet meet and elect the\ndeputies to the next higher governing\nunit, the rural soviet. Here we find\nthe first governing body for which the\n\u201cpoor peasant\u201d is denied a vote, but\nnot the last.\nThe next unit, of government in Rus\nsia is the county. The people do not\nhave a vote for the delegates to the\ncounty soviets. These county commis\nsioners are elected by the members of\nthe city and village soviets and the\nmembers of the rural soviets. Here\nwe have government one step removed\nfrom the people of the cities and two\nsteps removed from the \u201cpoor peas\nants.\u201d\nThe provincial soviets are elected\nthe city soviets and the rural so\nThursday, May 20, 1920\nviets. Again the people are without a\ndirect voice in their own government.\nThe constitution says: \u201cThe All-\nRussian congress is the supreme\npower.\u201d This body in the government\nof Russia takes the place of our con\ngress, our president and the cabinet.\nIt has the supreme legislative and ex\necutive power. Do the people have a\nvote for these all-powerful congress\nmen? Certainly not. The All-Russian\ncongressmen are elected by the city\nsoviets and by the soviets of the prov\ninces, who were elected by the city\nand rural soviets, the rural soviets\nhaving been elected by the local rural\nsoviets, whose members were elected\nby the people.\nCongress Not Governing Body.\nThe All-Russian congress is a very\nlarge body. The first congress met in\n1917. It numbered about 1,200 dele\ngates. The eighth congress Is now\n(January, 1920) in session and the\npresent membership has grown to over\ntwo thousand. It is a big, cumbersome\nbody, unfit for deliberative purposes.\nIt is more of a mass meeting, a plat\nform for the relief of those who have\nspeeches burdening their chests. The\ncongress never sits for more than a\nweek. It was never intended to be an\norgan of government. The constitu\ntion tells the story.\nSection 28 reads: The All-Russian\ncongress shall elect a central execu\ntive committee of not more than 200\nmembers.\u201d This takes the government\nanother step from the people.\nSection 80 says: \u201cWhen the All-Rus\nsian congress is not in sesssion, the\ncentral executive committee is the su\npreme power of the republic.\u201d But we\nhave not reached the end of the jour\nney from the people to the seat of\npower.\nSection 35 reads: \u201cThe central ex\necutive committee shall select a coun\ncil of people\u2019s commissars who\nshall manage the affairs of the Rus\nsian Socialist Federal Soviet Repub\nlic.\u201d\nBut let us read on:\nSection 87: \u201cThe council of people\u2019s\ncommissars is intrusted with the gen\neral management of the affairs of the\nrepublic.\u201d\nSection 38: \u201cFor the accomplish\nment of this task the people\u2019s com\nmissars shall issue decrees, resolu\ntions, orders, and in general take all\nsteps necessary for the proper and\nrapid conduct of government affairs.\u201d\nSection 40: \u201cThe central executive\ncommittee has the right to revoke or\nsuspend all orders and resolutions of\nthe council of people\u2019s commissars.\u201d\nBut a \u201cnote\u201d to this section of the\nconstitution reads: \u201cMeasures requir\ning immediate action may be enacted\ndirectly by the council of people\u2019s\ncommissars.\u201d\nThe council of people\u2019s commissars\nis 17 in number. The people had no\nvoice in selecting the people\u2019s com\nmissars ; they were not given a choice\nin picking the central executive com\nmittee; they were not allowed to vote\nfor the All-Russian congressmen; in\nthe rural districts the \u201cpoor peasants\u201d\nwere not even allowed to vote for the\nmen who selected the men who in turn\nselected the congressmen.\nAt the head of the \u201cSacred Seven\nteen\u201d is the chief of state, Lenine. At\nhis right hand sits Trotzky, commissar\nof force in clnuge of the army and\nnavy. When I think of the part the\npeople play in this newest form of\n\u201cfree\u201d government and the distance\nthey are kept from their country\u2019s\naffairs, I cannot help but see them\nthrough this constitution as though I\nwere looking at them through the\nwrong end of a pair of opera glasses.\nTruly it is a long way from the\npeople to the throne of Lenine. The\npeople make only the first and short\nest step. There are five long and im\nportant steps between the \u201cpoor peas\nants\u201d and the power, and three be\ntween the city voters and the real gov\nernment cif Russia.\nThe bolshevik government is a gov\nernment of officeholders, for officehold\ners and by officeholders. It is Lin\ncoln\u2019s formula reversed. I have heard\nit said that democratic government is\na failure because political officeholders\ndo not truly represent the people.\nThere is some truth in the statement,\nbut the people have a remedy; the\nsystem is not at fault. I cannot un\nderstand the logic for the faith that a\ngovernment which provides three or\nfive additional sets of officeholders be\ntween the people and the government\nwill make things better.\nTitle Conveys Much Meaning.\nThe title people\u2019s commissar is full\nof meaning. It is obese with power.\nThe title is copyrighted in the con\nstitution.\nIn December, 1918, Lenine ad\ndressed a letter to the American work\ningmen in which he said:\n\u201cLet incurable pedants, crammed\nfull of bourgeois democratic and par\nliamentary prejudices, shake their\nheads gravely over our soviet; let\nthem deplore the fact that we have no\ndirect elections.\u201d\nI suggest tha,t Lenine put the soviet\nplan before organized labor in the\nUnited States and ask the union card\ncarriers of America to give up direct\nelections in their labor unions and ac\ncept a scheme of government for their\nunions modeled after the bolshevik\nplan, and see how many followers he\nwill get. The rank and file of the labor\nmovement guard jealously their right\nto a voice and vote for measures and\nmen.\nLenine is a master machinist. If he\ncan prove that he designed and built\nthe soviet steam roller I know where\nhe can get a job when he quits Mos\ncow.\nWhat wouldn\u2019t Tammany give foi\nthe services of Lenine?\nICopyrlgbt, 1920, Western Newspaper Union)\nTHE DEMOCRAT, MINERAL POINT, WISCONSIN.\nMISS ELEANOR F.

It waa Interesting to note, he\nridded, that Mr. Malone was one of the\nspeakers at the meeting of protest\nagainst the raid on the Soviet Bureau by\ntho Lusk committee, and that Mr.\nPlnchot and Mr. Magnes nac! Been active\nIn various pacifist organisations during\nthe war. Mr. Colcord, he thought, was\nwith the Nation.\nAnother memorandum from Mr. Clark\nIn regard to Interesting manufacturers\nsaid that by careful publicity work the\nSoviet Bureau might get a great deal of\nfree advertising. Evidently he did not\ndream, however, of the advsrtlslng the\nLusk committee has given to It. Aa out\nlining the way In which the bureau\nplanned to work the document la inter\nesting. It reads:\n\"Our campaign for the opening of ex\nport trade would be greatly enhanced by\narranging directly or indirectly for\nmeetlnga of manufacturers In -several\nlarge centres of production, I. e..

I hope you can give\nhim some suggestions.\"\nMr. Clark sent similar letters to Pred\nerlc C. Howe, Commissioner of Immi\ngration, and Dr. Charles A. Beard.\nMethod Of Getlla Money.\nAs showing something about the way\nIn which the Soviet bureau has been\nreceiving money Mr. Stevenson offered\nIn evidence a copy of a letter addressed\nto United States Attorney Caffey In\nregsvd to some moneys brought here\nfor propaganda purposes by one Carl\nSandberg and which were Intercepted by\nthe Department of Justice. The bu\nreau evidently made a demand on Mr.\nCaffey for the drafts which had come In\nby way of Sweden, but he declared\nthey had not come into his possession\nThere was nothing to Indicate the site\nof the drafts.\nAt first yesterday there were placed\non evidence some pamphlets that had\nbeen seised at the Rand School. In\ncluding the letter of N. Lenlne to the\nAmerican worklngmen. Dr. Stevenson\nread from a pamphlet that purported\nto be the \"Decrees and Constitution\nof the Russian Socialist Federal Soviet\nRepublic.\" Aa he went along he and\nChairman Lusk made comments\nIt was Interesting, Mr. Stevenson said,\nto find a provision for universal mili\ntary training, as the radicals who had\nexpressed their appreciation of the Rus\nsian regime had opposed the establish\nment of universal military training.\n\"It would appear from this that they\nare not wholly averae to child labor\nIn Russia,'' remarked Mr. Stevenson a\nlittle later..\n\"Do you mean to tell me they have\ncourts over there that punish people\nfor disobeying the laws of that Govern\nment?\" asked Chairman Lusk. \"I\nthought that was what they were com\nplaining of In this country' that our\ncourts would punish them for not obey\ning our Government.\"\n\"Well, that makes It a crime to strike.\nThey cannot quit work.\" was the com\nment of Senator Lusk In regard to an\nother provision of the constitution.\n\"Let me see If I get you. Is the\nright of free speech taken away up there\nIn Soviet Russia? Is thst the Idea?\"\nasked the Senator In regard to another\nsection.\n\"Well, I think we will come to that a\nlittle later,\" was ths reply of Mr. Btev\nenson. '\n\"What, do they have searches over\nthere?\" was another question of Chair\nman Luak In mock horror.\n\"They appear to have,\" replied Mr.\nStevenson.\n\"It seems to me that this Is shock\ning.\" remarked the Senator turning to\nAttorney-General Newton.\nStrict Russian Rala Bared.\n\"Well, they will undoubtedly sfter this\nexperience amend their constitution,\"\nsaid the Attorney-General.\nThe declalons of the Revolutionary\nTribunal of the Press, having Jurisdic\ntion of \"crimes and offences against the\npeople committed by the press,\" are final\nand are not subject to appeal, Mr.\nStevenson declsred.\n\"It serves them right,\" remarked the\nAttorney-General fervently.\nMr. Stevenson declared the laws\nagainst seditious activities were de\ncidedly stronger In Soviet Russia than\nhere.\nAfter reading from a publication\ncalled \"The Soviet at Work,\" which waa\nwritten by Lenlne and found In the\nRand School, Mr. Stevenson, replying to\na question from the chairman, said that\na \"revolutionist\" was defined as \"being\na msn who stands for the overthrow of\nthe Government by whatever force and\nviolence Is necessary.\"\n\"Where can you And an American so\npedantic, so absolutely Idiotic.\" wrote\nLenlne, \"who would deny the revolution,\nary and progressive tendencies of the\nAmerlcsn civil war of 18I0-1S6S?\"\nOn behalf of the United Neighborhood\nHouses Harold Rlegelman sent a protest\nto Senator Lusk 'last night In regard\nto hla reported Intention to look Into\ntheir activities from a viewpoint of the\nteaching of radical doctrines.\n\"The settlement houses resent very\ndeeply.\" he wrote, \"the unfortunate and\nutterly baaeleas Imputations recently\nwidely circulated among the public upon\nwhose support these Institutions depend\nIn their earnest and far reaching effort\nto foster Amerlcanlxstlon snd sound\nloyal citizenship among our foreign\nborn population.\n\"However, In vindication of their\nsplendid record the settlement houses\nstand ready to gtve you all the Informa\ntion you desire.

Diplomatically it may\nI be called a Red \"buffer state,\" a\nbulwark of Soviet Russia against the\nNorthern White world.\nThe Karelian Workers' Commune\nwas pfficially formed June 7, 1920,\nby a degree of the Soviet govern\nment of Rusra. The Commune ex\ntends from the River Svir, in the\nsouth, across Lake Onega to the\nWhite Sea and around Kola penin\nsula to the Finish frontier, and again\nsouthward for a thousand miles\nalong white Finland.This equal to area\nabout iwo-th' rJs of Finland, con\ntains but a small population, about\n800,000. The politically and econo\nmically important Murmansk rail\nway runs entirely through this dis\ntrict, j\nThis Commune was established be\ncause revolution and only revolution\nwill realize the self-determination of\nsmall nationalities. When the imper\nialistic states speak about the self\ntermination of small nationalities,\nthey \"realise\" it by submitting them\nto the imperialist yoke. Under the\nrelia, continued to speak about the\n\"self-determination\" of Karelia,\nTheir propaganda, however, was\ncut short by revolutionary Russia,\nwhich did not speak loudly about\nself-determination for Karelia, but\nactually realized it.\nSoviet Russia Decrees Self-govern\nment.\nThe Russian Soviet government\npublished, June, 7, 1920, a degree\nconcerning Karelian self-government.\nAnd August 4, the All-Russian Cen\ntral Executive Committee and Soviet\ngovernment officially designated the\nplan of frontiers of this new sister\nrepublic of Soviet Russia. Wide self\ngoverning powers were given to the\nKarelian toilers in their own na\ntional and economical questions.\nThis \"Declaration of Independen\nce\" of the Karelian Workers' Com\nmune by the All-Russian Central\nExecutive Comnnrtee and Soviet gov\nernment, says in part as follows:\n\"Being in close touch with the\nworkers of all nationalities residing\nin Soviet Russia, the working people\nof Karelia are now entering a new\nphase of their history. The future\nguise of self-determination, the I tne Karelian toners rests m meir\nnatural riches and the peoples of the j wn hands- 0n the ba9'3 of e self\"\nsmall nations are exploited and op\npressed. White Finland, in its imperialistic\ndream about \"Great Finland,\" also\nspoke abcut the \"self-determination\"\nof Karelia. The Karelians happen to\nbe kinsmen to the Finns. Their lan\nguage is very much like Finnish.\nThis was enough fdt the Finnish im\nperialism to speak about \"self-deter\nmination\" of Karelia.\nEconomic Base of Finn Regard\nIn reality the hinship of the Finns\nand Karelians was not the cause of\nthe Finnish \"love\" of Karelians. The\nFinnish bourgeoisie, now playing\nwith imperialism, knew something\nabout the great natural riches of\nKarelia. There are great areas of\nforests. The total forest area is\nabout 100,000,000 hectares, or one\nand one-half times that of Norway!\nThe timber is worth hundreds of mil\nlions of dollars! So, it pays to speak\nabout the \"self-determination\" of\nKarelia in order to gain possession\nof this great wealth.\nKarelia is also rich in minerals.\nEven coal veins have been discovered.\nAlso zinc, copper etc. Iron ore is in\nabundance. These possibilities have\nbeen but little investigated. A single\nlake, Vikujavri, showed by investiga\ntion to contain about 11,000,000 tons\nof bog iron ore!\n\" The lakes and rivers are supplied\nwith fish in great abundance. Water\npower can be obtained from many\ngreat water falls; all of which means,\nthat once developed, Karelia will be\none of the most important industrial\ncountries of Northern Europe.\nThe Finnish capitalists wanted the\n\"self-determination\" of Karelia and\nof course, themselves as \"guardians\",\nin order to exploit and rob these\nnatural riches.\nAfter the Russian workers' revo\nlution, the Finish Whites concentrat\ned a part of their mercenary troops\nin Karelia. The Allies also sent ar\nmies. The purpose was to form Ka\nrelia as a white basis against Red\nRussia. Karelians were oppressed and\nforced to join the anti-bolshevist\narmies, but many Karelians fled\neither to deep forests or when pos\nsible, joined the Red Army. The\nWhite Finns began their \"self-determination\"\nwith plundering, robbing\nand murder.\nThe White rule, however, was put\nto an end by the heroic fighting of\nthe Red army. And in the spring of\n1920 the remnants of the Finnish\nWhites were driven from Karelia.\nBut in Finland as well as in other\nforeign countries the capitalists in\nterested in the natural riches of Re\ndetermination of nations before them\nlies the unlimited possibilities of\nnational development. The powerful\nunion of the working peoples feder\nated in Soviet Russia, will defend\nthe rights of Karelian toilers, their\nnational self-determination and their\nfreedom from the yoke of all ex\nploiters and oppressors. After fight\ning many hundreds of years against\na barren nature for their existence,\nthe Karelian toilers are now enter\ning from oppression and exploita\ntion onto the road of the family of\ndifferent nationalities freed from all\noppression and exploitation. .\n\"Hand in hand with the toiling forc\nes of the Soviet Republic, helping its\nheroic Red Army and allied with the\nsplendid sons of kindred Finland,\nthe Finnish red communist forces,\nthe toiling people of Karelia are\nfreed from the violence of the white\narmies and from the yoke of rob\nbers and exploiters. The toilers of\nKarelia, as well as the other peoples\nof the Soviet Republic, have, in the\nform of the Soviets of workers and\npeasants, at last received the means\nof the social freedom and peaceful\ncultural and national development.\nThd supreme authority in Karelia\nwill hereafter reside in the hands of\nthe Congress of Karelian Soviets, but\ntemporarily the affairs will be dir\nected by the Karelian Revolutionary\nCommittee. The Karelian Workers'\nCommune, in accordance with the de\ncision of the first All-Karelian Con\nference, will be in close touch with\nthe Russian toiling people and as a\nwhole with the Soviet Republic of\nRussia. Although being a part of the\nRepublic, differing from its other\nparts through the national and eco\nnomical conditions, it will receive its\nown able self-governing bodies with\na wide liberty of action The\nSoviet government of Russia greets\nwith deep joy the newborn Karelian\nWorkers' Commune, which joins the\nfamily of workers' Soviet Republics,\nand it has full confidence that the\nKarelian Commune will grow and\nbloom as the advance guard of the\nworking class in the far away North\nwestern part of the Federative Soviet\nRepublic. The Russian Soviet gov\nernment gives to the Karelian Com\nmune its promise, that it will give\nnil help and defend it in its work,\nseeing in this an important step in\nthe great construction work of the\nWorld Soviet system.\"\nAnd so side by side the new Ka\nrelia, the Karelian Workers' Com\nmune, is arising from the runs of\nthe capitalist system, erecting the\nworkers own structure of society,\nCommunism.\nTHIRD CONGRESS OF COMM\nCLEVELAND, OHIO, SATURDAY.

The Karelian Council\nof National Economy was established\nby a degree of the Karelian Revolu\ntionary Committee on September 30,\n1920. All economical questions and\nlocal economical councils as well,\nare under control of the Karelian\nCouncil of National Economy.\nThe work of this council is or\nganized on the same principles as\nthe council of national economy in\nSoviet Russia. A11 economical plans,\nfinances, etc., must be submitted by\nthe Karelian Council of National\nEconomy to the Supreme Council of\nNational Economy of Soviet Russia\nfor approval. The foreign trade will\nbe arranged in co-operation with\nSoviet Russia. The' economical de\nvelopment of Karelia is therefore\nonly a part of the general develop\nment of Soviet Russia.\nThe Future.\nWith the powerful help of the\nworkers of Soviet Russia, the Ka\nrelian toilers will be able to build\na new, beautiful Karelia. This, how\never, cannot be realized immediately.\nThe reconstruction requires both time\nand sacrifice on the part of the\nKarelian workers. In spite of great\nnatural riches, the Karelian Work\ners' Commune at the present is yet\npoor. There is a jcarcity of every\nthing. Industries, transportation, etc.\nmust be rebuilt.\nIt is a great task. But the Kare\nlian toilers are not afraid. They work\nand again work, because they deeply\nunderstand that they are working\nnot only for themselves, but at the\nsame time for the benefit of the\nworkers of the world. The stronger\nthey are able to build Karelia, the\nstronger will its influence become in\nFinland and in Scandinavia. And the\nnucleus of a Red Finland, of a Rod\nScandinavia, will grow, sweeping\nNorthern Europe with revolutionary\nexperience, enthusiasm and energy,\nhelping, on its part to make an ent\nire reu Scandinavia.\nCcujimittee of the\nnternarional sends its\nfraternal greetings to the Jewish\nCommunists. Comrades; you are\naware that the Executive of the Com\nmunist International, after having\ndiscussed the question in a special\ncommission, decided to invite you to\nenter the ranks of the Russian Com\nmunist Party. This decision was dic\ntated by the endeavor to attain closer\nunity of all communist forces. The\nExecutive appreciates the adherence\nof many members of the \"Bund\" to\nthe organization, which stood in the\nfront ranks during the dawn of the\nrevolutionary move'ment in Russia.\nThe Executive, however, reminds the\ncomrades that even the bolsheviks\nChanged the name of their party\nwhen the interests of the couse de\nmanded it. The Executive Committee\nindicates further that the German\nLefts have done the same, and a\nnumber of other countries in the\nWest are doing so now. There can be\nno victory for us iii the difficult but\nglorious struggle that we are wag\ning unless we have full unity of com\nmunist forces.

He is\nannounced to lecture on \"THE OPEN\nSHOP A MODERN RETURN TO\nslavery.\"\nMINOR is a hearty advocate of the\nresumption of trade with Russia as\na means of reopening factories and\nbringing employment to the unem\nployed. He maintains that the Rus\nsian market is the greatest field for\nthe sale of American manufactured\nproducts that can be found in the\nworld for many years,lo come, and\nthat it would be a suicidal policy for\nAmericans to permit that trade to be\nmonopolized by European govern\nments to the exclusion of tft United\nStates. The past policy of refusing\nthe enormous potential trade of Rus\nsia Minor declares to be the policy\nof fear and ignorance that has\nbrought unnecessary business stag\nnation and consequent suffering to\nthe laboring masses of the United\nStates.\nMINOR himself lived through the\ngreater portion of the Russian Re\nvolution in Moscow and later was\nan eye-witness of the Berlin uprising\nof Communists. He made the per-\"\nsonal acquaintance of the leaders\nof the Russian Soviet Republic and\nwatched that peculiar form of state\ngrow into its present strength. He\ncalls it a \"new form of civilization\"\nand believes that it cannot Mie de\nstroyed but must be dealt with.\nMINOR declares that the Interna\ntional financial interests responsible\nfor the prevention of trade with Rus\nsia, are at the same time using the\nbusiness depression for the purpose\nof destroying labor unionism in the\nUnited States. Minor is a firm be\nliever in labor unionism, which he\nhas seen grow to enormous strength\nin European countries. He tells of\nwhat he calls a \"spy system that he\nsays has grown to immense pro\nportions in the United States, per\nmeating every union and every im\nportant industrial plant. Spies, he\nsays, are used to demoralize em\nployes, and provoke trouble at mo\nments inopportune to the workers.\nHe claims to demonstrate that the\nold \"provocateur system\" of Czarist\nRussia has been adopted in many\nAmerican plants, to the demoraliza\ntion of industry, the degradation of\nemployes and to the promotion of a\nvery dangerous hysteria in the minds\nof many employers out of whom\nthe spies extract a luxurious living.\nMINOR contends that the Open\nShop Drive has an aim impossible\nof attainment, but that if attainable\nit would reduce American industry\nto a condition of slavery.\nAt a mass meeting to be held at\nRemney's Hall, E. 55 and Woodland,\non April 26th evening at 8 P.

HENRY.\nOn Monday, May 9 of this year,\naV Savannah, Ga., will begin the\nregular bi-ennial convention of the\nOrder Of Railroad Telegraphers, one\nof the so-called \"Sixteen Associated\nRecognized Standard Railroad Labor\nOrganizations.\" This organization\nhas a membership of approximately\n80,000. While tiie tejegraphers enjoy\na \"key\" positiin in the railroad in\ndustry they fliave been in the past\nsomewhat backward in taking advan\ntage of their tactical position, due\nto the fact that the majority of the\nmembership are rather conservative\nand uninformed as to the significance\nof the labor movement in its wider\naspects. There are many reasons for\nthis, one of which is that most of\nthe telegraphers live widely separat\ned from each . other in way stations\nand block offices, over the country,\nand are unable to meet with their\nfellow workers to discuss and con\nsider the burning labor questions of\nthe day. Although they have access\nto the telegraph, this medium is but\na poor makeshift for direct contact\nwith their fellow workers in meet\nings.\nBut while the majority member\nship is very conservative and in some\nfew cases reactionary, there is n\nwide-awake minority of fellow work\ners in this organization who at ' all\ntimes keep themselves informed on\nthe more important labor questions,\nboth national and international, and\nwho are ever ready to bring enlight\nenment to their comrades in the rail\nroad industry. These fellow workers\ncan not be too much, commended for\nthe great work they are doing. Self\nsacrificing, they at all times should\nmerit the support of increasing\nnumbers of the rank and file. .\nAt the Savannah convention, so\nwe are informed, there will be taken\nup on the floor ' many questions\nwhich are now agitating the labor\nmovement of the world. According\nto their importance, I classify them'\nas follows:\n1. Affiliation with the new Inter\nnational Council of Trade and In\ndustrial Unions the counter organi\nzation to the \"yeHow\" Amsterdam\nInternational Federation of- Trade\nUnions, which was organized in\nMoscow, Russia, July 15, 1920, with\na membership of approximately 10,\n000,000 workers. This new interna\ntional is the only organization of\nlabor unions sufficiently class-con\nscious and able to combat the rapid\nly reactionary policy of the infa\nmous Labor Bureau of The League\nof Nations, of which the Amster\ndam International is but an off\nshoot.\n2. Trade with the Russian Soviet\nGovernment that production in in\ndustry may be resumed and the\nwidespread unemployment now exist\ning be alleviated.\n3. Active support, both moral and\nfinancial, in the frame-up cases of\nMooney and Billings, Sacco-Vanzetti,\nwhich are now being exposed in all\ntheir rottenness. The recent confes\nsions of the perjured witness Mc\nDonald and the disclosures made by\nmany who took part in the frame\nup of Mooney and Billings, are now\nstirring the labor movement to ac\ntion as never before. The Sacco\nVanzetti case, which from all ap\npearances will be a second Mooney\ncase, is but another indication of the\ndepth to which the master class de\nscend in their dastardly desires to\nimprison or take the lives of active\nclass-conscious workers.\n4. The One Big Union of the rail\nroad industry. This was considered,\nat last convention but failed for\nlack of support.\n5. And last but by no means least,\nbetter support of the radical labor\npress. This means the papers that\nare not \"yellow\" THE TOILER,\nTRUTH, etc. X\nThat the introduction of these\nquestions will create great interest\nand be the cause of much heated de\nbate in the convention is not toie\ndoubted. That they wll be taken up\nfor consideration in other railroad\nunion conventions . we may feel as\nsured. Even though they may fail\nof passage, their being brought to\nthe attention of the rail workors will\ndo much to enlighten the workers,\nemployed in the industry and clear\nthe way for a much -better under\nstanding of the significance of\nevents in the future. We would sug\ngest to all readers of TH ; TOILER\nthat they bring this to the attention\nof telegraphers and other railroad\nworkers with whom they may be\nacquainted, pointing out to them\nwhere they may procure full infor\nmation on the above questions, or\nstill better, that they hand them\npamphlets and other printed matter\ncovering the subjects which we have\nenumerated\no\nUNEMPLOYED MEETING\nSunday, April 17\nACME HALL. 2.30 P. M.\nTom Clifford, Speaker.\nI .\nWHY SHOULDN'T\nFARMERS STRIKE\nBy Mac Mac Dowel. ,\nEvery morning before' daylight,\nthousands of farmhouses begin to\nstir. Lanterns flicker from house to\nbarn; cows are fed, and thena bucket\nby bucket can by can, and carload\nby carload, a great river of milk\nbegins flowing towards the city.\nThis great milk flow supplies 21\nper cent of the Protein,\n27 per cent of the Fav,\n5 per cent of the Carbohydrates\nconsumed by the people of the United\nStates every day. But these figures\nonly show the importance of milk\nas a carrier of the food elements.\nModern research in the physiology\nof nutrition has shown , that, hesidea\nthe food elements, other substances\nknown as vitamines are absolutely\nnecessary to sustain life, any emi\nnent professors bring .evidence to\nprove this and further to show that\nmilk is without doubt our most im\nportant foodWHY? Because it con\ntains BOTH forms of these vita\nmines and because both 'jrms are\nessential. Look at the ads in any\nstreet car by a yeast firm. Yeast\ncontains but one form. ,\nMilk then is a mighty weapon ,in\nthe hands of working farmer. He\nholds in his hands the health and\nhappiness of the nation. WHY\nSHOULDN'T HE USE THIS WEAP\nON TO STRIKE- THE MIDDLE\nMEN FOR A LIVING WAGE FOR\nHIS LABOR?\n.\nEvery morning before daylight\nthousands of city homes begin to\nstir. Gas jets flicker from room to\nroom. Men are fed. Then, one by\none, they go out into the street and\nbecome part of the great river of\nmen pouring into the hungry fac\ntories. This great army of men supplies\n100 per cent of the necessities of life\nmanufactured from the raw products\nof the Earth, which are consumed\nby the people of the United States\nevery day. Without the labor of these\nmen, all industry would stop. Babies\nwould die of cold. The city.jvould be\ndark. Transportation cease. Starva\ntion stalk abroad.\nLabor power then is almighty\nweapon in the hands of the city\nworker. He holds the health and\nhappiness of the nation. WHY\nSHOULDN'T HE USE THIS WEAP\nON TO STRIKE THE BOSSES FOR\nA LIVING WAGE FOR HI3 LA\nBOR? '\n.. .. J\nw navs tne anierence r mere\nnone.

So when\nhe strikes, as he did through his\nmilk organization of New York in\n1916, DON'T join the scab army of\nthe N. Y: \"Times\" by yelling about\nbabies not getting their milk.

When\nthe final struggle comes. When the\nSTRIKE is not for a living wage\nbut for the ownership of all industry,\nsuccess will be possible only if the\nworkers of the farms understand the\nstruggle. That understanding will be\npossible if they are made to feel the\nsupport of the city workers in their\npreliminary struggles against their\n\"Middlemen\".

One of the first\nrevelations to me on arriving in Rus\nsia was finding that the thought I\nhad entertained regarding the number\nand influence of Jews in the Bolshe\nvist government was quite erroneous\nAt heart I suspected, as so man;\ncasual readers have, that the Jews\nwere indeed the leaders of Bolshe\nvism in Russia. . I had this miscon\nception because of the prominence\ngiven to a number of men of Jewish\nparentage connected with the Bol\nshevist movement, Jn reports of news\npaper correspondents who had com\nin touch with these Jews in Russia.\nOnly the other day, I read some ar\nticles by a certain Mr. Davis, who\nrepresents himself a3 a major of the\nAmerican Red Cross, rehearsing the\nold yarns about the Jews of Russia,\nMr. Davis was not in Soviet Russia,\nand has no first-hand information on\nthe subject of the Russian Jews. Yet\nhis tales about them refuted by aC\nthat frightful actuality which I am\ngoing to portray, are published in\nmany American newspapers and\ngiven national circulation.\nBut it is not my object here to argue\nagainst Mr. Davis. I intend to teU\nwhat I found in the course of-my two\nvisits to Russia for the Chicago Dailj\nNews in 1919. I found that there\nwere Jews in the Commissariat for\nForeign Affairs, where a knowledge\nof foreign languages is required, and\nI found Jews in a number of other\ndepartments with which foreigners,\nnewspaper men from America and\nKurope, would necessarily come in\ntouch. These Jews were there main\nly because of their knowledge of for\neign languages or because they had\nlived in foreign countries. But when'l\nI got away from these department!\nand went to the internal vital organ\n, ization and bodies' of the Soviet gov\nernment, I found- a surprisingly low\nnumber of Jews. The Communist\nParty, which is the new name for the\nBolshevists, is composed of about\neighty per cent, pure Russians and\ntwenty per cent all other nationalities,\namong which, indeed, there is a con\nsiderable number of Jews. The rea\nson for this is twofold: First, the\nJews are the most intelligent of ,all\nthe non-Slav races in Russia; second,\nthe Communist Party is recruited\nlargely from the cities and the Jews\nfrom a large part of the urban pop\nulation in Russia.\nOf course, there is Trotzky, and\nthere are Zinoview, Kamenev and\ntwo or three others. On the other\nhand, there is Lenine and there is\nKrasin, the so-called economic dicta\ntor. There is Kalinin, the President\nof the Congress of Soviets the Rus\nsian Parliament. There is Chicher-i\nIn, the man who is responsible for\nthe foreign policy of Russia. There\nis Lustacharsky, Commissioner of\nEducation. These are all non-Jews\nThree of them are of noble birth. If\nyou go further, if you visit the vari\nous Commissariats, you will find thai\nthere are no Jews at all In many\nimportant departments.\nNow, this as regards the first im\npression that an observant visitor ob\ntains in Russia. Then, when you\ngo deeper into the matter, you find\nthat what the western world thinks\nof tlfii origin of Bolshevism, that the\ntheoiy of Karl Marx is Bolshevism\nyou find that this Is nothing but non\nsense. Lenine might be the finest\nexponent of Karl Marx, but the ma\njority of the Russian masses know\nnothing about Karl Marx, neither do\nthey understand Lenlne's interpreta\ntios of Karl Marx, nor doctrinaire\nSocialism of the various brands.\nNevertheless, the masses, the peas\nants, are Bolshevists, not in the sense\nof really intelligent fanatics for the\n\"cause, of Socialism, but Bolshevist.?\ninsofar as the idea bespeaks to them a\nmovement of the peasantry against.\nthe landlords for the purpose of se\ncuring first of all the peasant own\n. ershlp of the land.\nOne finds in walking the streets of\nMoscow, some peculiar things. One\n- of these is a monument erected last\nyear. It is a monument not to a\nJew, not to Karl Marx, not to a So\ncialist or a Communist, but to a man\nby the name of Stepan Razin, of\nwhom very few have heard. -You\nwill find in Russian history that Ra\nzin, three hundred yoars ago, when\nKarl Marx, Lenine and Trotzky were\nunknown, raised the banner of rebel\nlion on the Volga, Russia's, national\nriver, against the - rule of the Czar's\nin Moscow. And Razin who was\nnothing but a serf leading rebellious\nslaves is the typiflcation of Bolshe\nvism to the Russian peasants. II\nyou want to know Bolshevism, look\nup tonight in the Encyclopedia Bri\ntannica the history of Raain, the his\ntory of his dramatic rise until he\nseized many provinces, enlisting in his\nranks hundreds of thousands of re\nbellious peasants, and threatening\nMoscow. For three hundred years\nBolshevism has been smoldering in\nRussia.\nLess than two hundred years ago.\ni man by the name of Pugachov. also\nrebel leader, repeated the episode of\nRazin. Ha also was stopped. Razin\nwas publicly tortured and executed\nin Moscow and where he was ex\necuted three hundred years ago, you\n1 will now find a monument raised by\nthe risen Russian people, who see It\nin the symbol of their centuries-old\naspirations. This is Bolshevism. On\ntop of this, is built Communism and\nLenine's ideas of a new social order,\nbut if not for the peasant movement\nwhich is three hundred years old and\n. which is purely Russian and is the\nmainstay of Bolshevism, Soviet Rus\n. sia would not be where she is today.\n: So much for the part of the Jews in\nthe origination of Bolshevism and its\nleadership.\nNow, go down to the Jewish peo-\nJ pie, down into the ghetto. Go to a\ntown like Dvinsk, or Cornel, not very\n' big towns, but still having thirty or\nforty thousand Jews each. Begin to\ntalk to Jews of all kinds, of all types\nand classes. You are an American\nnewspaper co-respondent. Those dis\npatches which told of the Jews being\nleaders of Bolshevism are still in the\nbackground of your mind and here\nare the real Jews of Russia. Are they\nBolshevists? No. Emphatically no.\nFirst of all you find they are more\nbitter In their opposition to Bolshe\nvist rule than any other class of the\npopulation. You find upon investiga\ntion in a city like Gomel, where there\nare. thirty-five or forty thousand tine or to America. Finally, they want\nJews, less than two hundred Jewish ' to go where they can be -sure of mak\nCommunists. You find most of them . ing a living. I speak of ninety per\nare waiting for some miracle to hap- j cent, fully, without exaggeration, of\npen that would change the Soviet !\ngovernment so as to strike a medium\nbetween Denikin as the Soviet, and\netolve a democratic government as it\nis understood in this country, allow\ning the Individual the opportunity to\ndevelop his own genius, particularly\ninjthe field of commerce.\nThe Jew will not stand-the unlim\nited power of the state, the pressure\nfrom the top. The Jew is individ\nual. He has his own strivings and:\nambitions, whether in business or in\nany other line. And the present state\nin Russia is a condition approaching\na dictatorship in which individual\nenterprise in business is suppressed.\nNow, why are the Jews against the\nBolshevists? The Bolshevists have\nmade no pogroms; and Denikin has.\nOf course, they are against Denikin.\nTake that ' for granted. They are\nagainst all those indulging in massa\ncres. You ask, why are they at the\nsame time against Bolshevist Russia?\nThere are some very convincing\ncauses. The first is that the Russian\nJew' is against capital punishment,\nagainst any dictatorship. It goes\nagainst the grain, the make-up of the\nJew, and many -Americans know it\nfrom contact with the Russian Jews\nin this country. The Soviet govern\nment was responsible for quite a\nnumber of executions. I am .not\nspeaking of the red terror of which\npeople in this country have very\ncrude and distorted ideas. I am\nspeaking of executions after a tri\nbunal had passed upon the cases.\nThere were numerous executions of\nthat type.\nSome of the executed were Jews.\nIn most cases the executed are ban\ndits; to be sure, many former of\nficials of the Czar and some members\nof the Communist Party found guilty\nof corruption are executed. Many of\nthe Jews could not stand capital pun\nishment in a government which pro\nfesses to be Socialist. This affected\nthe younger Jews, those of radical\ntendencies. A lar more potent rea\nson is the fact that the mass of the\nJews in Russia were small business\npeople. They were commissioners,\nbrokers, trades people of various de\nscriptions, and shopkeepers. And the\nSoviet government has closed nearly\nall the private shops; has discon\ntinued all the brokerage businesses\nof various types and has deprived the\nJews of Russia of their means of\nlivelihood. I am speaking of the ma\njority of the Jews.\nThe Soviet government is essential\nly a government of the peasants. Now\nthese Russian peasants are the ma\njority of the people and in spite of\ntheir, dislike of the Communist gov\nernment or the Communist theories,\nthey are for the Soviet government,\nand we, who believe in majority gov\nernment, cannot help facing this sit\nuation. Here is a more or less legiti\nmate government, peasant govern\nment, which aims to eliminate the\nJew as the middleman from the eco\nnomic field, which meazus from life itself.\nNow, when you find this out, when\nyou discover that the Jews are simp\nly deprived of their source of income.\nof their shops, which are either con\nfiscated or sold out, you are not sur\nprised at finding that the bulk of the\nJewish population of Soviet Russia\nis against the government. They ap\npreciate that there have been no\nmassacres in Soviet Russia. They ap\npreciate the efforts of such people as\nMaxim Gorky, Lunarcharsky and the\nwife of Lenine, who have constituted\nthemselves into a committee to com\nbat anti-semitism.\nBut, here is the situation. Here\nis a government which seeks to be\nproletarian. In the system which the\nSoviet government seeks to erect\nthere is no place for a middle class;\nand the I Jewish people, it must be\nacknowledged, are a middle class ele\nment almost everywhere in Europe,\nespecially everywhere I saw them.\nAnd when you come to the prospects\nfor the future of the Jewish people\nin Russia, you are up against this\ndead wall, worse than any massacres,\nwall of reality, that there is no\nplace for the Jew in the Russia of\ntoday and in the Russia which the\nSoviet leaders are trying to erect.\nNow, take the case of the Ukraine.\nIn the \"Ukraine, there were massa\ncres; tens of thousands have been\nkilled, and hundreds of thousands\nmaimed and roboed of their homes\nand their property.\nBut in the Ukraine, under Denikin\nand Petlura, there was more in the\nfuture for the Jews who remalneo\nalive, because Petlura and Denikin\nstand for business, for private proper\nty; they stand for all those things\nwhich allow \" individual efforts and\ntransactions in which the Jews en\ngage in order to make their living.\nBut today the Ukraine is in the hands\nof Soviet Russia, eighty-five or ninety ,\nper cent, of it; and there is no ques\ntion but that Petlura will be wiped\nout, if he is not already. Now the\nUkraine, as far' as I can figure out,\nis going to stay In the hands of\nSoviet Russia. The reason why it left\nthe hands of the-Bolshevists last sum\nmer was due to the fact that they\nsent down into the Ukraine a lot of\npeople who didn't know the country\nand tried to Impose upon the Ukraine\nthe same Soviet rule that functioned\nin Moscow, a system that did not\nmeet with the approval of the\nUkranian population. Lenine and\nthe others recognized this be\ncause they paid dearly for it; and\nwhen I left Soviet Russia they did\nnot intend to 'repeat their mistake of\nlast summer. They will probably go\na long way to meet the peculiar de\nmands of the Ukrainian peasants and\nallow theni a certain freedom of\nindividual effort and private owner\nship, even if limited; and because of\nthe present extraordinary military\"\nstrength of the Soviet government, in\naddition to the reason I have just\ngiven, I believe UKramia - will not\nleave the hands of Soviet Russia, You\nthen get about four million Jews\nadrift from Odessa to Petrograd in\nthe hands of the Soviet govern\nment; thousands who are torn away\nfrom the old moorings, who can't\nget back into the old channels be\ncause the government will not allow\nthem; and if they try to do so, they\nare considered speculators, they are\nprofiteers. Now that the\" war is\nover and the Soviet government is\npaying much attention to internal\nconditions, speculation will be stop\nped, because there is no \"fun,\" to use\na slang expression, about the methods\nof the Soviet government If it in\ntends to stop speculation, it will stop\nit, even if some lives will have to be\nsacrificed on the gallows.\nNow, what do the Jews say? What\ndo they think? They want to leave\nRussia. That is the first thing. And\nthis I conceive to be my duty to try\nto interpret as closely as possible\ntheir sentiments. I can tell you what\nthey told me, that they are waiting\nfor the first opportunity to get out of\nRussia. They want to go to Pales-\nthe Russian Jews; both of those who\nhad gone through the massacres in\nthe Ukraine and of those who lived\nunder Soviet rule and had their\nshops and stores confiscated.\nIt is a 'very grave dilemna. One\ncould not answer those people. They\nexpect miracles. Miracles f ronV Amer\nica. They came to me in crowds after\nfinding out that I was from America;\nthey considered me more than a God\nsend; a man who had dropped from\nthe skies; from .the United States! It\nseemed unbelievable! And many of\nthem actually didnt' believe and don't\nbelieve to this day that I was there'\namongst them. They came to me with\nthe same words, repeating again and\nagain the question as to ' what they\nshould do, and as to what the Amer\nican Jews, America, Humanity, Wil\nson, would do for them.\nNow Jt must be stated as a fact\nthat most of the Jews are Zionists in\nRussia. I left Russia not so very\nmany years ago I am speaking of\nmy first coming to the United States\nand there were a good many people\nthere whom I had known who were\nnot Zionists, people who did business\nwith Moscow or some other interior\nRussian cities, and who considered\nRussia a good country, with certain\nreservations. Now these people were\nZionists..\nThey were Zionists because life has\nmade Zionists of them; not because\nthey learned more of Palestine and of\nits possibilities, but because they felt\nthat they had to go somewhere and\nbecause they believed that perhaps\nPalestine will be the land where they\ncould go.\nMeanwhile the Jews of Russia\ndrag out a miserable existence. Most\nof them do it by selling piecemeal\nthe chattels that they had succeeded\nin concealing in the last pro years.\nNow, take my native town, for in\nstance, sixty per cent, of the popula\ntion of which are Jews. The , Jews\nthere were not well off. They were\npoor, on the whole, from the point of\nview of American standards; but\nsomehow they made a living. There\nwere more shops and stores in that\ntown than one would imagine the\npopulation could support. Such was\nthe typical Jewish town in Russia. I\ncame there now and I found most of\nthe shops empty and closed. It was\na Sunday. The town used to have a\nfair when the surrounding peasants\nwould come into town. They were\npoor peasants. The land was not fer\ntile; it was marshy and woody. But\nstill they had something to bring and\nthey brought it in the good old days\nand sold it cheaply. Now I found that\nthe same poor peasants who used to\nwear shoe of bark of their own\nmanufacture and coats and caps of\ntheir own making, these peasants, es\npecially the peasant girls whom I re\nmember so distinctly coming into\ntown ten ir fifteen years ago bare\nfoot, now came into town dressed\namazingly well, wearing good shoes\nand silk kerchiefs and silk waists\nThe poor ignorant peasant who used\nto wear shoes of bark now had a pair\nof good boots. Where did theytfome\nfrom? They came from the city, not\nexclusively from the Jews, but the\nJews were in the majority in the city.\nSo, you understand, it was mostly\nJewish boots and shoes and silk ker\nchiefs and waists and the hundred\nand one little things such as pins and\nwatches that these peasant girls were\nwearing while bringing a few eggs or\nsome butter into the city to exchange\nfor additional finery. In other words,\nthese peasants were sucking out the\nlife blood of the town. I saw that not\nonly in' the Jewish, ibut also in the\nRussian towns; and I fteft Russia with\nno sympathy for the peasants because\nthey are the worst explpiters. If cer\ntain people in Russia used to think\nthat the Jews were exploiters, they\nnow see that the Russian peasants\nthemselves are drinking the blood of\nthe Russian cities.\nI will tell you the story of a rela\ntive of mine who had a piano in the\ngood old days. I stopped in his home\nthis time. The piano was not there.\nWhere was It? Did he sell it. No, he\nhad not sold it; he had it hidden\naway, probably in some cellar. He\nformerly was a fur merchant, but\nnow he was doing nothing. And for\ntwo or three morfhs, this relative of\nmine had been bargaining with\nneighboring peasant for the exchange\nof the piano for some flour. You\nsee, the piano was once worth about\nsix hundred rubles. A pood of bread\nthirty-six American pounds was then\nworth a ruble and fifty kopecks in the\nsame town. The peasant was quite\nwilling after several weeks of bar\ngaining to give now six poods of\nibread. costing according to the old\nstandard nine rubles and according\nto the present standard seven thou\nsand rubles, for the piano, which\nbought today in Moscow, where such\nthings are being sold and bought\neven now. would cost fifty thousand\nrubles. Well, my relative was not yet\nat the end of his rope ana so ne was\nsuite slow about it. He did not con\nelude the deal, but whfen 1 left he\nsaid: \"We don't know how long this\nwill go on. The day may come when\nI will sell the piano, and after the\nbread that I got for it is consumed\nmay have to sell my last shirt.\"\nThings will not come to that\nnow because of the improving inter\nnational situation; but the future of\nthe Russian Jews Is not bright, - not\nbecause of massacres, hut because of\nthe social system which certain peo\nple, including some of Jewish origin,\nare endeavoring to build up In\nRussia.\nNow, one can be for this social\nsystem or against it. This is not the\nquestion here. The point, to be driven\nhome here to everyone, to every \"Jew\nand to every non-Jew is this: The\neconomic situation of the Jews of\nRussia is desperate. They are pre-1\ndominantly of the middle class, the\nonly large middle class element thai\nRussia has ever had. There is - no\nplace for a middle class under Soviet\nRussian government. The Jews of\nRussia cannot be Bolsheviks. Their\nstomachs compel them to be against\nSoviet rule, against Bolshevism.\nIt must be admitted that , in the\nnew order which will emerge in Rus\nsia there will be a place for a cer\ntain number of Jews. A certain num\nber of Jews .intellectuals of a certain\ntype and other young bright chaps\nwho can adapt themselves to tondi\ntions will get into the varjous eco\nnomic departments- and make good\nundoubtedly. But the majority of the\nRussian Jews will he found at the\ngates of Russia, opening into Western\nKurope, as soon as these gates are\nflung open, and it is Incumbent upon\nall humanitarians, jews and non\nJews 'alike, to face this problem with\nall the gravity that it deserves and\nsolve it in a constructive and broad-\nminded manner.\nLOCAL BOYS\nNew Haven, May 1 Yale's fel\nlowships and scholarships for the\ncoming year were announced yester\nday, the Connecticut list being as\nfollows: University scholarshiDs.\nHenry Chauncey Anderson, Strat\nford, Sheffield Scientific school. 1920.\nelectrical engineering: Arch Frank\nRazatsky, Bridgeport, Sheffield Sci\nentific School, civil engineering.\nWTW SCHOLARSHIPS\nENGINEERS OF\nWORLD WAR IN\n. -NEW SOCIETY\nWashington, May 1 General Lan- i\nsing H.

Living as a\nRussian, with forged documents pur\nporting him to be an official of the\nExtraordinary Commission, D\\ikes\nrealized that unless he obtained some\naetual employment that would serve\nas a valid reason for exemption\nfrom military service he would be\n.taken into the army, the freedom of\nJiis movements would be cut off and\nhe would lose all chance of being\nable to study closely the various\nphases of life under the Bolsheviki.\nMoreover, an incident occurred\nwhich indicated that the Bolshevist\nauthf rities had discovered his pres\nence in Petrograd and that it was\nnecessary for him to perform a com?\nplete transformation of his person,\ndisguise and occupation.\nBetrayed by a Friend\n\"It was soon after I had made a\nsecret trip to Finland to communi\ncate with London,\" said Dukes, \"that\nI discovered on my return that some?\nthing was seriously wrong. A Rus?\nsian officer, a man who pretended\nto be a friend of mine and did me\noccasional services for monetafy con\nsiderations that aggregated nearly\n100,000 rubles,?betrayed me. J do\nnot know whether he really intended\nto betray me or thought that I would\nnot come back and sought to gain\nthe favor of the Extraordinary Com?\nmission by revealing one of my ad\ndresses?the only one known to him.\nYou understand, of course, that I\nhad to maintain several addresses,\nand it was very rarely that I spent\ntwo consecutive nights at the same\naddress. The nightly raids con\nducted by the agents of the Extraor?\ndinary Commission on a wholesale\nscale compelled me to move about\nconstantly.\n\"On my return to Petrograd.\nwhich was effected in a manner very\nsimilar to my original entrance, al\nihough on other occasions I re?\nturned on foot by way of the Kare\nUan forests, I was informed by a\nfriend I met in the street that my\ncforementioned place of abode had\nbeen discovered and that agents of\nthe Extraordinary Commission had\nbeen there the night before and had\nmade a thorough search of it. For\ntunately, I had left nothing incrim\ninating in my room\\ but I realized\nimmediately that the agents of the\ncommission would in all probability\nreturn to my place and that if once\narrested my game would be up. Al?\nthough I trusted my friend implicit\nly, I thought it advisable to pretend\nthat I would leave Russia the same\nnight. I told him so. Instead of\nleaving, however, I went to my\nroom. My landlady informed me of\nthe visit of the agents of the Ex?\ntraordinary Commission. She told me\nthe details and described the ap?\npearance of the raiding party, so\nthat by her description I was able\nto get an idea of who composed the\nraiding party. It was important for\nine to know that for future con\ntingencies.\nk \"I then told the landlady that I\n? was going away to a city in the in\nWlerior of Russia. Instead of going\naway, however, I went'to the other\nend of the town and after exploring\na number of chemists* shops I final\n- ,y procured a bottle of German dye.\n1 resolved to change my appearance\nand disguise completely. I had\nlearned that one of my identifica\ntion marks in the records of the Ex\ntjadrdinary Commission was that I\nhad a front tooth missing. That\nwas true. But I had provided air\nartificial one in London, which I im?\nmediately put to use.\n\"Fearing that it would be danger\no.us to go to any of the other of my\nplaces of residence, lest one or all\nof them had also been discovered\nand agents of the Extraordinary\nCommission might be lying in wait\nfor me, I decided to take a chance,\nto enter some stranger's house, tell\nfcim that i was being hounded ajui\nask for'some new clothes and per\nnr'ssion to dye my hair. I chose at\nrandom the house of a physician.\nHe proved most sympathetic and\ngave me the hospitality of his home.\n1 dyed my hair, donned some shab\nby workmen's clothes end a cap and\nwalked out into the Street a new\nman.\n\"I walked back to the house, the\naddtfss of which was betrayed by\nwl&eged fr|e&4, and presented'\n___\nmyself at the door as an agent of\nthe Extraordinary Commission. I\nmade sure, of course, before doing\nso that there was no caller from\nthe commission at that moment in\nthe house. I called for the porter,\nwho knew me wejl in the disguise\nI affected when eoming to that par\n'ieular house, and in a brusque man\nner asked for myself. The por\nter's knees began to tremble. He\npleaded that I had gorte away and\nhad not been seen for days, but of?\nfered to inform the authorities im\nmediately on jny retum,\n\" 'Well/ I cried, adding a few\nand, I fear, unprintable, cuss words,\n'don't you forget to do that oi* else\nJWmarch you to Gorochovaya Dva.'\nt'The porter bowed low and\npromised to do as I bid. After\nthat I never again returned to that\nhouse.\"\nHaving thus successfully thrown\nthe agents of the Extraordinary\nCommission off their scent, Dukes\nwalked out into the street, bqt re\ncalled to his consternation that he\nhad allowed his papers purporting\nhim to be an agent of the commis?\nsion to become oyerdue. At this\ntime there were wholesale raids\nunder way in Petrograd. In four\ndays nearly half the houses in\nPetrograd had been searched and\nthere was cpnstant danger of being\nstopped in the street by an agent\npf the Extraprd^nary Commission\nand. asked, for one's papers. Agents\nof the commission were obliged tp\nrenew their papers at certain in\ntervals. Duke's, Papers being oyer?\ndue, he would certainly have been\ncompelled to make an explanatipn\nof the fact to the first agent who\nchose to stop him and thus lay him?\nself open to sprious consequences.\n'?\"Vyith searches in every house I\ndared not spend the night at any of\nniy usual quarters,\" gaid Dukes.\n\"This was so not only because, of the\ndanger tp my own safety, but also\nbecause of the danger involved to the\nother occupants of any of my dpmi\nciles. The regulatipn was that the\n.tenants of any house were held re\nsponsible for the proper character\nand vocation of all the occupants,\nand if I had been arrested for lack of\nproper papers I would have brought\nmisfortune upon innocent people,\nespecially if the arrest should lead\nto the discovery of my real identity.\nMy fellow tenants would have been\nmade to pay dearly for harboring a\n'counter revolutionist,' nay, the al?\nleged head pf all the 'counter-revo\nlutionary' conspiracies in Russia.\n\"There was only one place I could\ngo. It was the flat of a friend who\nhad told me on a previpus occasion\nthat if ever I were in danger he could\nhide me successfully. He lived in\nthe Ligovka, a long, wide street of\nnotorious riot, running from the\nNevsky Prospekt to the Obvodny\nCanal. Knpwing he came home late,\nI knocked at his door at a quarter\nto 11. There was no reply. I\nlearned afterward that he also was\nin hiding.\nSlipped By Raiders\n\"As I emerged from the house\njust after 11 a band of guards came\naround the corner to clear the street.\nThey rushed first to round up the\ncrowd of street traders, who were\nstill disposing pf their goods. Hav?\ning nothing in my hands, I managed\nto slip by and ran across the street.\nI walked hurriedly down the Li?\ngovka, crossed the canal and turned\ntp the left. My object was to get\ndown to the river and hide among\nthe old broken up barges. But under\nthe first railway bridge there stood a\nsentinel. I turned abruptly to the\nright and walked out of the town.\n\"\"It was midsummer?the White\nNights?and there was no coyer of\ndarkness. When I arrived at the old\nVolkoff Cemetery, a mile Put beyond\nthe town, I climbed through the pal\nings and looked for a tomb that\nwould shelter me. I found myself in\nthe wild and overgrown section of\nthe graveyard appointed for the Old\nBelievers. The crosses were huge\nand quaint. They had thick wooden\nrings where the cross arms joined\nand bighoods over the top. Dark\nand worm eaten, they were carved\nwith weird figdres, most of them\nhaving a skull and crossbones at the\nfoot of the cross, and they stuck up\nat all angles out of the negleoted\ngrass apd weeds. The tomb I chose\nwas an old stone onp, dry, but very\ncold. The tombstone said that one\nMichael Semeshko had been buried\nthece thirty years before.\n\"It drizzled in the night ancj I was\nvery miserable. From the gulf the\nmuffled thunder of a bombardment\nfloated over the still night air. It\nwas the garrison of Krasnaya\nGorka, left to its fate by the retreat\ning forces of Yudenitch, fighting\namong themselves. Next morning\nI walked intp town and lay down on\na bench at the Tsarskoselski railway\nstation and slept. I saw some cu\nrious things that day. I saw a\n'woman' six feet high, with a thick\nveil, striding rapidly out of town as\nI hqd done the evening before. When\nthe figure had passed I noticed it had\ntop bpots on under the skirt.\n\"The next three days friends\nbrought me food to a garden in the\ncity. In the evening, when the raids\nand searches started I went out to\nMichael Semeshko's tomb. On the\nfourth night I was very tired. I\ndon't know if I slept, but it seeined\nto m,e $s if the weird crosses of the\nOld Relieyers swayed and danced,\nand death?s hsads leered hideously.\nAbout 4 o'clock in the morning, when\nI was sitting prr a stone, the branches\nparted a few paces away and an old\nman peered through the leaves. I sat\nperfectly motipnless. He stared at\nme a moment, seized the nearest\ncross, wrenched it out of the soil,\nswung it over his shoulder and dia\nappeared. He took the cross for\nfirewood.\nPreferred the Tomb\n' _ut there1 was nothing for me to\ndo for the moment. I had the choice\nof Michael Semeshko's tomb or\n'Gorochovaya Dva,' and I found the\nformer more hospitab'le. Michael\nwas5 good to me, and I thank him\nfrom the bottom of my heart. I\nwonder if he knows the service he\ndid h^e in his final resting place?\nSome day I will come back and place\na wreath on his tomb. And Ihave\npromised that I will burn a candle\nto him in the beautiful Kazan Ca?\nthedral every year on June 15, when\nI return.\n\"My connection with military serv?\nice dates from about this point,\"\nContinued Sir Paul. \"I have already\nstated that owing to the fact that\none of my flats had been discovered,\nthat the Extraordinary Commission\nhad gotten on to me and my work\nand that I had to perform a com\nplete transfiguration of my person\nand occupation, I decided to enter\nthe military service of the govern?\nment. I cut off all conneetions with\nmy former friends, with the excep\ntion of two whom I trusted fully, one\na doctor and the other Romanoff.\nI obtained a position through friends\nas a draftsman, a craft in which I\nam proficient, in a military pjant at\nthe Ochta, a suburb of Petrograd. I\nhad to copy designs and blue prints\nof machine guns and ammunition.\n\"Once inside the factory, with\nproper identification papers signed\nby the original signatures of the\nproper Soviet officials, I was safe.\nTo make my safety doubly certain I\ngained the confidence of the Bol?\nshevist authorities at the plant and\njoined the Communist party. Thence\nforward I was a good comrade.\n\"Owing to the fact, however, that\nI had to spend fully six hours daily\nat the plant I found myself ham\npered in my work. My movements\nwere limited and I found that I could\nnot devote as much time as I4\nshould to the study of the situation\nand the gathering of informaiion\non the operation of the idyllic Bol?\nshevist regime. I decided upon a\nvcourse of action. I obtained from\nmy doctor friend a certificate say\ning that I was in weak health and\nhad to have several weeks' leave. It\nwas granted me with much expres\nsion of sympathy by the commissar\nin charge.- My daily routine then\nwas to obtain all Bolshevist papers,\nread them carefully, make notes on\nsuch points on which I wanted addi?\ntional information, secure that in\nformation and, in general, doing\nthe work of an intelligence officer.\nMy work over, I would hunt the\nmarkets for food. J lived chiefly\n.on black bread, butter and tea,\nwhich I bought from the peasants\ncoming to town at extravagant\nprices. My existence was more or\nless placid. The main thing I\nhad to avoid was detention or arrest\nduring raids on houses where I\nmight be staying or visitipg. There\n?was no particula.r danger involved\nin this at that time, since my\npapers and conneetions were in per?\nfect order. Still, I\\felt that it\nwould l?e best not to undergo tfe ex\nJ?feiX^^:::.:^.::::. :. ^\nqIR PAUL DUKgS as he is and in two of the disguises he\n^ usfd in Russia. At the left he was impersonating a Rus\nsian citizen of the unofficial class, white at the right he was a\nmimition worker in a Rolsltevik factory\nperience of detentipn or arrest and\nI carefully avoided both.\n\"A regulation which caused great\nincopvenienge was the examination\nof docunients of identification on\nenteripg houses. This duty was\nimposed upon house porters, who\noften performed it earelessly. But\nin some houses the examination was\nvery striet. It depended on the\nhopse committee. Every house in\nPetrograd and Moscow must, ac?\ncording tp jthe regulatipns, elect\nand maintain a house comrajttee,\nwhich is responsiblp to the authori\nties for everything that happens in\nthe house.\n\"When the measure was first intro\nduced during a period of many\nstrikes in Petrograd I was interned\n| in one house for five days without\nj being able to leave, because the back\n| entrance, the only one left open, was\n| picketed by sailors. The house was\ni a large one, containing more than\nj fifty flats, and had two front en\ntrances, both of which were closed\nat the order of the commissar in\ncharge of the search. The latter\nmistrusted the house porter, and to\nshow their zeal the Communists as\nsumed the duty of picketing the yard\nentrance themselves.\n\" 'Too many suspicious looking\ncharacters come in and go out of this\nhouse,' observed the commissar to\nmy host.\n\"His suspicions were*probably not\nunfounded when one consjders the\nnumber of 'sackmen' who made use\npf the back stairvyays and that the\nentire civil population was engaged\nin 'speculating' in one thing or an?\nother. I regarded rnyself now as an\n'unsuspicious' character, but, unfor\ntunately, I was not 'written in' at\nthis house. The picketing beginning\nearly one morning, I should have been\nbrought to book for staying the\nnight without giving notice the even?\ning before. Two women were caught\nlike this the first day, but they turned\nout to be only pro'stitutes, who had\nbeen to see some of the sailors, so'\nnothing was said of it.\n\"Every stranger who was admit\nted left his papers with the picket,\nwho returned them when the visitor\nmade his exit. The fifth day the\nsailors' zeal abated. My host got i\nhimself put on picketing duty and\nlet me out, returning to me at the\ngate my papers, which he had taken\nwith him in his pocket.\nAn Expert at Fits\n\"The sailors had spoken of search-1\ning the whole house, but they did not j\nput their threat into execution. In i\nsuch an emergency I should have \\\nprobably produced a 'fit.' I prac-j\ntjced 'fits' and became quite expert. I\n\"On one occasion, overtaken by a |\nsearch, I had such a 'fit' that the in- j\nvestigator from 'Gorochovaya Dva,' j\nwho was conducting operations,!\nwould not have let his men touch me i\nwith a ten-foot pole. My host was <\narrested on the charge of having had !\nan interview with an Englishmanj\nmasquerading as a Russian three:\nmonths before. I often wondered j\nwhat the investigator would .havej\nsaid had he been told subsequently i\nthat while he was searching the!\nstudy the 'Englishman' was in the!\nnext room burning a couple of pass- {\nports with different names, but with i\nthe same photographs, and hidingj\nthe ashes up the chimney.\n\"A brazen show pf self-confidence\nwas the best security at such mo-!\nments. The person just mentipned |\nas arrested on my account got off a\nfew days later by an extraordinary\ndisplay of audacity, outwitting even\n'Gorochovaya Dva.' I confesS I am\nnot one of those who love to plunge\ninto any. hazardous enterprise just\nfor the fun of it. In many a tight\ncorner I was really shaking in my\nboots, although I managed tp keep\nthose articles firmly on the ground\nand maintain an attitude of self\n_\nppssession. A laugh at such mo\nments serves well. A lopk of im\nbecility is at times an aid, too.\n\"I once entered a house the door\nof which was unguarded, intending\ntp let myself in by a key to a flat\non the first floor. In the hall I heard\na curipus commption and jingling of\nkeys just above. I knew the flat was\nempty and realized at once that a\nsearch was on. The guard had not\nyet been placed at the front en\ntrance. I tiptoed out pf that hall\nabout as quickly as I ever tiptoed in\nmy life. But the floor tiling was\nloose and rattled- A pair of heavy\nbpots canip charging cfown the stairs\nafter mp like a ton of bricks, and\njust as I emerged into the street a\nbig, bruta} looking fellow held me up\nwith a revolver.\n\"4Stop!' he shouted. 'Whom do\nyou want?'\n\"I Looked up innocently at the\n.lintel.\n\"'Ahl'I said, 'all right. This, I\nsee, is No. 19. I am looking for\nNo. 17.'\n\"My long, straggling hair, shaggy\nLeard, blue spectacles and face cpn\ntorted in a nervous grin must have\ngiven me the appearance pf an utter\nimbecile. i limped off like a cripple.\nThe man glared at me very hard,\niowered his revolver and let me go.\"\nl>incd Soviet Officials\nBeing on leave and having consid\nerable leisure on his hands, Dukes,\nfortified with papers of. unimpeach\nable integrity, visited fregly various\nSoyiet institutions, ate at Soviet eat\ning houses and entertained members\n,o? the Extraordinary Commission's\nstaff at dinner.\n\"It was great fun to chat with\n-these gentlemen,\" said Sir Paul,\n'to curse all 'counter-revolution\nists' and to discuss the affairs of\nthe world.\"\nWhile thus engaged, however, rfe\nattracted to himself the suspicions\nof a Russian who, although not in\nthe Extraordinary Commission, was\nclosely allied with the Bolsheviki.\n\"I was visiting a friend of mine\nwho had lived in England for many\nyears,\" said Sir Paul. \"It was Jn\nthe evening. As I came in my\niriend grew womed.\n\" 'I am very sorry you came at this\ntime,' he said. '1 expect a man here\nwithin ten minutes whom I do not\ntrust altogether. I think he does'\nvarious services of a secret nature\nfor the Bolsheviki. However, it\nwon't do for you to leave. The house\ncommittee pickets at the door, in\nwhom I have little confidence, may\nregard you with suspicion and re?\nport your visit. You stay and make\nthe best of it.'\n\"I remained. Presently the ex?\npected caller arrived. He prpved jto\nhave very strong Bolshevist sympa\nthies. After discussing various af?\nfairs he launched forth upon a bit?\nter denunciation of Engjand. I used\nthis as my opportunity to join in\nthe conversation. We spoke Eng?\nlish, my friend having thought itad- j\nvisable to introduce me as a Rus- I\nsian who had lived in England.\n\"'I detest England,' said I. 'I'\nwill never forgive the English for j\nwhat they have done to me. They\nkept me in prison for two years, and\nit was only upon the outb'reak of the\nrevolution in our country that I was\nable to regain my liberty and return\nhome.' -\n\"The unwelcome visitor looked at\nme suspiciously. He appeared to be ;\nturning over something in his mind. \\\n\" 'Why/ he said, 'you seem to have I\na pretty good English accent. Rus-!\nsians usually have diffictllty in com-!\nmanding such an accent.'\n\"Then he looked me square in tbe !\nface and asked in a lower tone:\n\" 'Who are you, anyhow?' *'\n\"I looked him square in the eyes i\nvnd calmly cohcocted the following\ntale,\n\" 'You see, sai?TI, 'I was bom in.\nRussia. My parents were musicians\nand traveled about a great deal pver\nthe face of the glpfce. When seven\njears old I was taken to Australia,\nthen to America and then to Eng?\nland, where we stayed for many\nyears without retuming home even\nfor a visit. I was educated in Eng?\nlish schools, and when the imperialist\nwar broke out I flatly declined to\njoin tbe ariny. Fpr this I was put\nin prison and kept there for two\ny_ars. The damned English treat\neu all of us Russians who refused\nto fight like swine. We were all\nmfghty thankful when the revolu\ntiqn broke and we could come\nhome.'\n\"I said all this with such perfect\n?cquanimity apd subdued yet un\nquestionable hatred for England\nihat the guest was convinced. He\nstayed a little while longer and de\nparted. I lost no time iii following\nhim.\n\"It was soon after the elections\nto the Petrograd Soviet, elections\nwhich the Bplsheviki carried in the\nface of universal opppsition by fraud\nand terrpr. The new Soviet was to\nmeet. It was to be a gala occasion,\n\"The Bplsheviki having won a\nmajority of the 1,3Q0 seats, only\nabout 200 being carried by so\ncalled 'pqp-partisaps,' but actually\nbitter opppnents of tbe Bolsheviki.\nthe Bolshevist press procliiimed with\ngreat glee that despite tbe activities\nof counter-revqlutionists the prple\ntariat was still**pehind them. This\nwas a contemptible falsehood. I will\ndescribe to tho American people\nlater just how the Bolsheviki won\nthe elections. Sujfice it to saV that\nthe Bolshevist cjaim of a victory on\nthe basis of the confidence of the\npeople was ppre fraud. If there had\nbeen any free election, without the\nmethods of terrprism, deceit and\ncompulsion practiced by the Bol?\nsheviki, the Petrograd Soviet would\nhave been overwhelmingly apti\nBolshevik.\nAttended as a Guest\n\"I wanted very much to attend a\nmeeting of the new Soviet. I could\nnot attend it as a member, but I\ncould attend it as a bidden guest.\nFor this a special piandate was re\nquired. I had no difficulty in obtain\ning it through my factory connec\ntions, and as a bidden guest, with\nthe right to vote, I attepded the first\nmeeting of the new Petrograd Soviet\nand watched with great interest the\nconduct of the proceedings. Not\nonly are bidden guests permitted to\nvote, bpt any Communist riff-raff\nwho manage to get into the hall are\npermitted to exercise the franchise.\nThe Bolsheviki apparently regard\nthis as immeasurably superior to the\neffete, bourgeois parliamentarianism\nof Western Europe. ;\n\"Yes, the Communists had!\ntriumphed. The hydra of counter- j\nrevolution had been wiped out. The\nSoviet was secure. English and\nAmerican visitors from abroad j\ncould again be safely introduced to [\nwitness the enthiisiasm of the\nchosen people for the Soviet gov-!\nernment.\n\"But, there was a cloud on the\nhorizon, a very little cloud, but a\nblack one. Why had the Com\nmunist majority been reduced de?\nspite the Communist propaganda\nand other strenuous campaign\nmeasures? All the election results\nwere known except those at the j\nBaltic works, which were never an-'\nnounced. The election here had\nbeen entirely apnulled because a]\nshout went up 'We are for Kol-;\nchak!' Pid they meep ft? I don't;\nknpw. I think they nieant that if i\nthey could pbtajn a free Soviet, a!\nfree press, free speech, free trad-f\ning, then they would vote even forj\nKolchak. I don't think the work-j\nmen knew of or cared much for\nDenikine and Kolchak. What they\ndid want was to get rid of the Com?\nmunists.\n\"The Communist party was un\ndoubtedjy a little disconcerted. It\nwag rumpred that one of the n<?wly\nEnglishman, Seeking Informatic^\nAbout the Soviets, Rose to\nPosition of Trust\nelected non-party members had,\nfreely prociaimed himself from a;\npublic platf orm to be a Menshevik,!\nwhich produced a storm of cheerlng j\nfrom the workers who heard him-1\nOne member waa openly elected as t\nan anarchist. Could nothing be\ndone to eradicate this poison? The\nelections must certainly be better\nmanaged next time.\n\"The military section of the\nSoviet took the first steps to\n'eradicate this poison.' They issued\na regulation making attendance at\nSoviet meetings compulsory. g In\ncase a member failed to do so three\ntimes in successiqn he was, if a\nCommunist, to^appear before a\nparty committee and make an ex\nplanation; if a non-partisan he was\nto be fined and his mandate can\ncelled.\n\"Armed with my mandate, 1 made\nmy way on a hot summer day to the\nfirst meeting of the new Petrograd\nSoviet of Workmen's and Soldiers'\nDeputies. Turning down from the\nLiteiny Prospekt, past the ruins of\nthe old law courts, burned. out in\nMarch, 1917, I reached the famous\nTauride Palace, now called the Pal?\nace of Uritsky, in honor of the as\nsassinated Chief of Police of Petro?\ngrad, the seat of the former State\nDuma. As I entered I pictured to\nmyself the memorable days and,\nnights of March, 1917, the burning\nexcitement, the enthusiasm, the\ncrowds seizing the news speets, the1\nthrongs within the Duma, all aglow\nwith hope of a new order and a new\nlife, at night spldiers lying almost\non top of each other, gladly offer\ning their lives for their country and\ntheir revolution.\n\"I tbpught, top, of a little man\nwho had said to me: 'What do lib?\nerty and brotherhood mean? Good\nwill and kindnpss. But I see hatred,\nmuch hatred, all about me, and no\none can foretell what will come of it.'\n\"The old man's raisgivings proved\nto *be unfortunately well founded.\nThis time there was none of the glow\nand enthusiasm of the great days of\nMarch 17. There was an air of sup\npressed resentment, of disillusion\nment, of falsehood and counterfeit\nenthusiasm. The hand of Bolshev\nism had wiped out all noble feelings,\nall great illusions, all fine aspira\ntions. It was the air pf the old\nCzarist officialdpm, with spies and\nprovocateurs lurking in all corners\nwatching every one passing by. In\nthe old days, in tbe days of Gore\nmykin and Stolypip, there were at\nJeast some people inside that meet?\ning hall who could rise from their\nseats and hurl mighty protests at th?\nheads of the tyrant of the people.\nTo-day, even this small measure of\nsatisfaction was not to be obtained.\nThere was nothing but Machiavel\nlian cynicism, brutal selfishness, un\nbounded hatred for everything and\nany one venturing to disagree with\nthe ppwers that be.\nMachine Guns Everywhere\n\"Tbe fact of civil war stood out\nboldly both inside and outside the\npalace. Machine guns pn motor\ncycles were posted outside, on the\nporch. All the windows bristled\nwith machine guns, the greatest and\nmost potent argument'of Bolshevism.\nA company of soldiers guarded the\nentrance.\n\"The auditorium of the Tauride is\nnow altered with decided improve?\nments. The wall behind the tribune\nhas been removed and a deep alcove\nmade, where the members of the\nexecutive. committee and special\nguests sit. The executive committee\nnumbers forty people. All legisla\ntion is done by the executive commit\nlee and the praesidium. The Soviet\nproper nevpr takes part in Iegisla\ntion. It is a mere rubber starap\nwherewith is sealed the will of the\nBolshevist chieftains.

Soviet meetings are held every\ntwo or three weeks, and afford com\nmissars and others invited to attend\nan opportunity to exercise their ora\ntorical propinquities.\n\"The meeting had been officially\nannounced for 5 o'clock in the after?\nnoon, but the day had been an anx\nir-us one, for, though the strike epi\ndemic at that period had been sup\npressed, dissatisfaction was rife,\namong the railway men in partieular\nand the workers in general.\n\"Complaints were being made\nagainst the elections, the food re\nstrictions and the canceliing of fur\nloughs. Why had the workers been\nallowed to elect yirtually none but\nCommunists? Why did the Bolshe\nvik government restrict thtir right\nto bring food with them from the\nprovinces? There had been meet?\nings ip the auditorium in the after?\nnoon, to which the man had been in?\nvited, not to make know|s their de\nmands, but to listen to Zinovieff, dic\ntator of Petrograd, who endeavored\nto persuade them not to make any\ndemand?\n\"Jt was 8 o'clock bejfpre the new\nmembers. and^guests eiuld enter the\nhall. lieanwhile they walked abot|\nin the bi# bare vestibules w__j-*.\nCommunist literature is sold by tfe\nbushel.

In the course of its\n-737'.???? - riet r?gime has built\nj? a tremendously numerous official?\ndom, a new bureaucracy, constructed\non the basis of the old imperial bu?\nreaucracy, both from the point of view\nof essen: od and. to some ex?\ntent, of :tual personnel.

These elements are\norganically incapable of creative ahd '\nefficient work. Most of the. better ele?\nments have been either hounded out\nor else have left of their own accord,\nunable to stand the conditions and the\nassociation. Those who remain have\nneither the will nor the opportunity to\ndo really good work. But the ineffi?\nciency of the Soviet bureaucracy has\nalso a deliberate cause, which lies in\nthe general dishonesty of the official\npersonnel. Of course, corruption and\ndishonesty are to be expected, consid?\nering the sort of elements that pre?\ndominate in the bureaucracy, but their\nactual extent is startling, even after we\ndiscount this very important fact.\nLet us take bribery as the most im?\nportant and glaring of the forms of bu?\nreaucratic corruption. Several months\nago the official organ of the Russian\nCommunist party, the Moscow Pravda,\ndevoted a series of articles to the ques?\ntion. In one of these articles, pub?\nlished on February 4, 1921, the author\n('escribed one of the phases of Russia's\nnational life, which provided an espe?\ncially fertile field for bribery and offi?\ncial corruption. Under the Soviet sys?\ntem of nationalized industry, i. e., be?\nfore Lenine's \"revised\" economic poli?\ncies went into effect, the only indus?\ntrial enterprises which could be run\noutside of governmental supervision\nwere those organized on a cooperative\nbasis. Officially, these enterprises were\nsupposed to receive their raw materials\nfrom the government and sell their\nproducts to the government. As a\nmatter of fact, however, many of these\nenterprises were in the hands of pri?\nvate business men. The government\n\"farmed out\" to these pseudo-coopera?\ntive enterprises orders for part of the\nvork which was supposed to have been\ndene by the nationalized factories. And\nthe process of placing these orders and\nof supplying for them the necessary\n' stocks of raw materials and fuel be\ni came a source of revenue for the Soviet\n: officials. The article in the Pravda has\nthe following description of this sys?\ntem of bribery:\n\"Each private entrepreneur has to\npay bribes to everybody in the Soviet\ninstitutions. He pays for the very fact\nof receiving an order; for the drawing\nup of the contracts; for the estimates;\nfor the right to receive cash payment;\nfor the right to obtain raw materials\nand fuel; and to countless controlling\nand receiving commissions. If his\npapers have to go through a number of\nstages, the same thing happens in all\nof them. '\nOfficials Who Violate Law\nAccept \"Legitimate Bribes\"\nTheu follows a rather interesting\nclassif cation of bribes:\n\"Some officials take a bribe and in\nexchange for that really violate a law;\nin the terminology of those who take\nbribes this is called a legitimate bribe.\nOthers receive bribes merely for tak?\ning a document to their superiors to\nbe signed. Some take bribes for not\ninterfering. Still others take bribes\nsimply because they can get them;\nsuch officials are known as plain\nswindlers. Every investigation, every\ninspection, really turns out to be an?\nother bribe assessment.\"\nWhat happens if a man refuses to\ngive bribes? On the same authority,\nwe are assured that \"it is quite im?\npossible not to give bribes; reasons\nwill always be found for dragging the\ncase indefinitely, for refusing to fur?\nnish the materials required, or for fur?\nnishing materials that are not of the\nright quality.\"\nThe effects of this state of affairs\nrpiHE photograph above shows General Budeny, commander of the\n?* Red armies, and his staff. Note the large picture of Karl Marx\nhung on the v:all of their headquarters. Below, to the left, is a new\nview of Trotzky, and to the right, Kalenin, President of the Soviet\nRepublic, making a stump speech.\nare numerous. In the first place, the\nsystem of bribery adds greatly to the\ndemoralization of the whole system.\nThose who give bribes are always in a\nposition to obtain \"favors,\" such as\n\"exemption for their families, includ?\ning even distant relatives, from labor\nduty; exemption from restriction of\nliving quarters, etc.\", (Pravda, Febru?\nary 4, 1921). In the second place, he\ncause of official corruption, the pseudo\ncooperative enterprises are able to ob?\ntain raw materials and fuel at the ex?\npense of the nationalized enterprises,\nwhich is a tcrriffic loss to the govern?\nment, because most of the enterprises\nto which orders are \"farmed out\" man?\nage to sell most of their product pri?\nvately through secret channel?. The\nPravrla introduced the whole discussion\nj of the question of bribery with the fol?\nlowing significant statement:\n\"It is well known that many of our\nI state-owned factories and foundries are\n\\ either at a standstill or else are barely\nfunctioning at all. . . . Yet the pri?\nvately owned enterprises, masquerad?\ning under the guise of 'home' and co?\noperative enterprises, are working and\nflourishing.\"\nIn the third place, the owners of\nthese privately owned enterprises, the\nbribe givers of the system, are rapid\ndeveloping into a capitalist eh.'-,\nof the most unenlightened type; the\nofficial Soviet organ characterized this\nprocess by saying that \"again a new\nbourgeois class is being created, a\nr.cw speculative bourgeoisie, which ac?\nquires greater and greater wealth and\nlives ?n luxury, while the laboring\nrea---- are starving.\" Lenine's \"re?\nvised\" policies have practically legal?\nised this situation and have, conse\ni quently, opened the way for bribery on\nan even more extensive scale.\nThis and other forms of official cor\nruption are not limited to this one\nphase of governmental activity; they\nare found everywhere. As one of thj\nreasons for this, we find in almost all\nSoviet discussions of the situation a.\n'.1\nlaconic statement to the effect that it\nis impossible to live on 'the salaries\nthat the Soviet government pays its\nofficials, in spite of the fact that as I\na rule the officials are better off than '\nany other group of the population,\nwith the exception of the army. But\nthe government itself has not enotign ,\nto give; so it closes its eyes to of?\nficial corruption and gives its silent\napproval to bribe taking and the rest\nof the officialdom's arsenal of tricks'\nfor augmenting the means of livelihood,\nhood.\nThere are some phases of govern?\nmental activity in which nier, are\nfrankly expected to steal or d i som -\nthing of the kind. For example, tha\nemployees of the Soviet warehouses,\nwhere the government keeps its stocks\nof manufactured goods for distribu?\ntion; the guards were paid last year\nfrom 2,100 to 3,000 rubles a month,\nwhen it required at least twenty\ntimes as such to provide a living.\nIn commenting on the situation thus\ncreated, the Feotiomic Life, the of?\nficia! economic organ of the Soviet\ngovernment, said in its issue of\nAugust 3, 1920:\n\"It is clear that, barring a few ex?\nceptions, all those who undertake such\ndifficult and responsible work for so\nsmall a compensation do so in the\nexpectation of stealing.\"\nIt is quite apparent from these illus?\ntrations, which can be multiplied al- !\nmost: indefinitely, that, whatever the\nCommunist leadership hoped that their\nadministrative apparatus would be,\nwhatever that apparatus was at the be?\nginning of the r?gime, it has now de?\ngenerated into the most corrupt bureau?\ncracy that ever existed?a bureaucracy\n???\nCommunist Party, Inefficient\nAnd Bold, Becomes Hierarchy\nCriminals and Reactionaries Mingle in Extravagant\nGovernment. Forcing Will Upon People Through\nBarbarous Extraordinary Commission\nthat by the very nature of things com\nbines colossal inefficiency with mon\natrous dishonesty.\nThe Communist leadership is no\nonly powerless to put a stop to thii\nBacchanalian orgy of official corrup\ntion. but finds itself compelled to pre\nserve it, for the bureaucracy is one o\nthe important factors in the systec\nwhich the Soviet r?gime has built U]\nfor the preservation of its politics\npower.\nThis system consists of a ser-.es c\nprotective measures, developed am\nperfected at different times, but all di?\nrected to the same end. viz., the contin\nuance of the Soviet regime. The Com\nmunist leadership, in'us work of po?\nlitical administration, apparently pro\nceeds on the theory that, its rule as i\nminority can be preserved ever, in tin\nface of active hostility and oppositior\non the part of the masses of the peo\np!e. provided it succeeds in buildinj\nup a sufficiently powerful apparatus o'\ncompulsion and coercion, the personne\nof which would come definitely to re\ngard its personal, material interests\nas bound up with the preservation o1\nthe whole r?gime. The Soviet regime\nhas succeeded in building up such ar\napparatus, though most of its factors\nare so degenerate as to be progres?\nsively disintegrating.\nGroups Bribed To Be Loyal\nB> Concessions in Food\nThe first element of the protective\napparatus of the Soviet r?gime ;s ih?\nsystem of group discrimination in the\ndistribution of food and other neces?\nsaries of life. At first this system was\nrather haphazard and the population\nwas divided for purposes of discrimi?\nnation into groups roughly correspond?\ning to the former class division?.\nWorkmen, for example, would receive\nmore than professional men, the latter\nmore than capitalists, etc. As time\nwent on, however, an almost scientific\nsystem o' group discrimination in dis?\ntribution was worked out by the So?\nviets. It goes under the name of \"pul?\np?se distribution.\" Croups are singled\nout for favorable discrimination in ac?\ncordance with their relative usefulness\n? to the Soviet regime. So into the first\nor the most favored group went most\n, of the officialdom anu of the army and\na selected group of workmen in vital\nindustries. Other groups of the popu?\nlation fared much worse than the first\nj group.\nSome groups of the population, then,\nhave been and still are bribed into loy?\nalty to the Soviet r?gime by distribu\ni tive discrimination. As a counterpart\n. to this the r?gime found it necessary\n? to intimidate and eras:; the active op?\nposition of other groups. The systi -n\nof intimidaron : ?? second element\n: of the protective apparatus of I\n? viet r?gime.\nIn actual applical this system ot\nintimidation took the form of an abro?\ngation of all civic rights. The storv\nof what civic liberty men::- under Rus?\nsian Communism has been told too\noften and too authoritatively to need\nrepetition here beyond a sheer enu?\nmeration. With the whole press in the\nhands of the Sovi I : i vernment ami its\nagencies; with fre? dorn of speech tin\nunknown entity; with ect >ns eon\ntrolled complete:-.- by the Communist\nminorities ard nullified by the authori?\nties at will whenever non-Communist\ncandidates are returned, the intimida?\ntion of the opposition is carried to thai\n>ith degree of efficiency.\nBut the opposition continues its\nwork?underground, when it\nwork openly.

This was at Waco, Tex , where the case\nagainst the men never has been\nI pressed.\nThe Klan's activities opened in\nj Houston on December 8, when 500\nj Klansmen attired in their uniforms\n! paraded through the main streets\nbearing innumerable banners. This\nwas the first sign of the Klan. Since\nthen its activities have increased with\neach day and night.\nThe first, act of the Klan in Houston\nwas the tarring and feathering of R.\nI I. Hobbs, a prominent lawyer. Three\ndays before he had received a warning\nfrom the Klan to leave town. He\nignored it. He told many of his\nfriends of the threat letter. On the\nnight of February 5 he was kidnaped\nfrom his apartments and taken to the\nedge of the town. His hair was\nclipped and he was tarred and\nfeathered. Ho w?r accused of being\n\"too friendly with negroes.\" Hobbs\nleft town nnd went to Alvin. h small\ntown near Houston. Two days later\n!\n! he was taken to the edge of that\ntown in daylight, his car was pointed\nI west and he was ordered to go in that\ndirection and, not stop until he was\n' ouf of Texas. He never has been\n! heard of since.\nFollowing the tarring affray the\nKlan sent $600 to the Young Women's\nChristian Association for the home?\nless girls who had been burned out\nby a tire.\nNegro Bellhop in Dallas\nBranded With \"K.

A bellboy in the\nAdolphus Hotel, the prided hostelry of\nthe South, was taken from the hotel\nby masked men. On his forehead he\nwas branded \"K. K. K.\" in silver\nnitrate. He was brought back to the\nhotel and turned loose in the lobby.\nMany guests crowded around the\nbranded negro. He was charged with\nintimacy with a white woman in the\nhotel.\nOn May 21 Dallas witnessed the\nlargest parade in the history of the\nKlan in Texas. It was on Saturday\nnight and the streets were crowded.\nSuddenly the great white lights along\nElm Street. a city thoroughfare,\nwent out. With only a few lights here\nanil there from shop windows piercing\nthe darkness, the street was enveloped\nin a mass of jet. Down the long\nstreet came the ghostly parade of the\nKlansmen. The fiery cross, at the\nhead, illuminated the way. The city\nof 150,000 persons was still as the\nwhite- robed ligures moved on silently\nmysteriously. Behind the bearer of the\nfiery cross came the long line of silent\nmen. Fvery twentieth man carried ?i\nbanner with an inscription.\nThe first on? read, \"The Invisible\n( Empire.\" Others were: \"Here Today\nHere Yesterday, White Supremacy,\nHere Forever,\" '''.00 Per Cent Ameri?\nca:\", isiri.\" \"Pure Womanhood,\" \"Dallas\nMust Be Clean,\" \"All Pure W.-ute,\"\n\"For Our Mothers,\" \"For Our Sisters,\"\n\"For Our Daughters,\" \"Parasites\nMust Go,\" \"Gamblers Must Go,\"\n\"Grafters Go,\" \"Our Little Girls Must\nBe Protected,\" \"Degenerates Must\nGo,\" \"The Guilty Must Pay\" and \"The\nRight Will Prevail.\"\nThe parade had formed inside the\nMajestic Theater, Dalias's million-dol?\nlar showhouse. It covered a loop of\nsix blocks and a block wide. The pro?\ncession had its moral effect upon Dal?\nias. Police blotters have been prac?\ntically clear of vagrants and loafers\nand gamblers.\nAfter this came the whipping of Ed?\nward Engers, an overseas veteran, on\nthe night of June 13, because he was\nalleged to have mistreated his former\nwife, who had remarried fifteen months\nbefore he fell victim to the Klan's\nwrath. Since newspapers have edi?\ntorially flayed the attack upon Engers\nand much indignation has arisen from\ncitizens, some of the Klan have denied\nthe attack upon him. Some admit it.\nEngers was at work in an oil station\nlate on the evening of June 13 when\ntwo men can.e into the place.\n\"We are officers and have a warrant\nfor your arrest,\" one of them said.\nEngers went with them.\nThe two men led him to a secluded\nside street. There fight masked men\nwere waiting in an automobile. The\nengine was running.\n\"Throw him in!\" one of them\nshouted.\nEngers attempted to back away from\nthe men. A pistol was pushed in his\nside. He was threatened with death\nif he yelled. He was thrown into\nthe car. It moved away faat.\nTaunts and threats were made by many\n, of the men while Engers was being\ncarried from the town.\n\"I yelled for help when they carried\nme into the Fair Grounds.\" Engers said\nafter the beating. \"One of them hit\nme ;n the face and another one put his\nthumbs into my eyes. After we got out\na long ways 1 was carried to a lon< y\nspot.\"\n\"Tie him to the post.\" one of the\ncaptors instructed.\n\"That isn't, necessary,\" Engers an?\nswered. \"? took more from the Huns\nthan you can ever give me. I'll take\nwhatever'? coming like a man.\"\nRegardless of Enger's prom se to\ntake his \"medicine,\" he was bound to\nthe post and the lash was thrown on\nhis back about a score of times.\nActs of violence including ti ? tar\nand feather ptrties and. be;;' -, ;\nincreased from time to time. The\nKlan bobs up here and there over\nnight. They parade in the smaller\ntowns nightly, terrorizing the inhabi?\ntants, warning many of them to leave\ntown as they are \"undesirable citi?\nzens.\"\nThe wise heads of the South are\npredicting an unpleasant future of\nstrife, and perhaps civil war, if the\npresent condition continues.\nBecau .e of the unres.t and discon?\ntent manifest among the citizens of\nTexas and states adjoining as the\nresult of the activities of the Klan, the\nquestion has come into the limelight\nin the Texas Legislature. Representa?\ntive Wright Patman. of Casa County,\nintroduced a bill last week urging the\nLegislature to pass it because of the\n\"lawlessness and anarchy that now en?\nvelops the state.\"\nThe bill was defeated by a vote 53\nto 49.

These insti?\ntutions are bu'lt along the lines of the\nvarious branches oi the famous im?\nperial police under the Czar r?gime,\nwith very important modifications,\nhowever. From the point of view of\ntheir personnel these extraordinary\ncommissions consist partly of those\nwho constituted the various branches\nof the imperial police and partly of\nmen of all sorts of criminal type. It\nis not an uncommon occurrence to find\nformer policemen and the crimin?is\nwhom they had hounded now working\ntogether in the extraordinary commis?\nsions for the glory and advancement o?\ncommunism.\nExtraordinary Commission\nCarries Out Terrorism\nThe extraordinary commissions have\nbecome a real nightmare in the life of\nSoviet Russia. They are bad enough\nat the all-Russian center, under the\nguidance ?,?;' its bloodthirsty heads ?\nDzerzhinski, Latsis and Peters. But\nthey are still worse at the local cen?\nters. Their power is almost unlim\nited and their ruthless cruelty unprec\nedented. Even the government officials\nthemselves are afraid of them. Their\nmethods, their cunning, their arbi?\ntrary irresponsibility, are such as to\nhave made them an almost supernat?\nural terror in the eyes of the Russian\npopulation. History will, probably,\nnever know the extent of their bloody\nactivities. While the all-Russian cen?\nter issues from time to time reports\nof its work, which are appalling\nenough, the countless local centers do\nnot consider, it necessary to make any\nreports or, apparently, even to keep\nrecords. They are probably content\nwith the records that remain written\nin blood through a!l the limitless\nstretches of the vast country.\nThus, to til?- numberless cohorts of\nSoviel bureaucracy, in the various\nbranches of government, in the army,\nland ??i the extraordinary commissions,\npreservation of the Communist r?\ni gime means their continuation in posi\noi persona] advantage which they\nbly have had under any\nr?gime, and which they ?vould cer\ntainly lose, mosl probably togefher wi h\nth< ir lives, if the ?vgime should be over\nthrown. 9 reflected in\nof the Communist leader\n???

Struve asserts\nthat the government of General\nWrangel admits the possibility of\nnegotiations with the Bolsheviki on\nsuch points as establishing a line of\ndemarcation between the territories\ncontrolled by the Bolsheviki and those\nunder control of General Wrangel,\nwhich include the Crimea and parts\nof Southern Russia, to enable General\nWrangel to consolidate his forces and\nhis hold upon the territories under\nhis control.\nM. Struve emphasizes the point that\nhis government will agreo to negotia?\ntions with the Bolsheviki only on the\nbasis of equality and will accept no\npreliminary conditions. Should the\nBritish government accede to the de?\nmands of the Bolsheviki that General\nWrangel disarm, M. Struve says, the\nWrangel government will immediately\ndiscontinue all conversations with the\nBritish and will utilize all its forces\nin fighting the Bolsheviki. M. Struve\nasserts that General Wrangel views\nwith equanimity the possibility of the\nBolsheviki hurling their force against\nhim immediately after concluding\npeace with Poland and feels confident\nof being able to resist their assault.\nPossibilities of Negotiations\nM. Struve's statement follows:\n\"Our view on this subject (negotia?\ntions with the Bolsheviki) has been\nstated by me with exhaustive com?\npleteness in the declaration made to\nthe Allied representatives at Spa. We\nare guided in our foreign policy by\nthe fact that General Wrangel's army\nat the present moment represents the\nonly power existing in the territories\nof the former Russian Empire carry?\ning on an armed struggle against the\nBolsheviki, having freed from their\ndomination a certain stretch of terri?\ntory and reintroducing there normal\nstatehood. With a view to a demarca?\ntion between these territories and the\nrest of Russia held by the Bolsheviki\nand to afford to the government of\nGeneral Wrangel the opportunity for\ncompleting the work he has begun, we\nadmit the possibility of negotiations\non these subjects.\n\"In this sense the proposal of the\nEnglish government for a conference at\nLondon was not unacceptable to us.\nThis, however, on condition that we\nparticipate in , such conference as\nequals and also that our admission be\nnot restricted by any preliminary con?\nditions, as, for instance, our withdrawal\nfrom the northern districts of the\nTauride province.\nRecognition Is Demanded\n\"If the form in which the English\ngovernment made its proposal is unac?\nceptable to us, then the reply of the\nBolsheviki to the proposal must pre?\nclude all possibility of our participa?\ntion in the conference, should it be\ncalled, on conditions offered by the\nCommunistic government. The Bolshe?\nviki demand the disarmament of the\narmy of General Wrangel and its evac?\nuation from the Crimea, i. e., complete\nliquidation of the anti-Soviet forces in\nRussia. Still, we exist de facto, and\nrecognition of such existence we will\nmake an absolute condition of our par?\nticipation in the work of the confer?\nence, should one be held.\n\"We do, of course, admit the possi?\nbility that the Bolsheviki, after they\nshall have freed a considerable part of\ntheir forces on the Polish front, will\nfling them against the army of Gen?\neral Wrangel. We regard such a pos?\nsibility without any undue anxiety, and\nthe prospects of further armed struggle\nagainst the Bolsheviki are by no means\ndark for us. The experience of the last\nfew years has demonstrated clearly\nthe fact that the military strength of\nthe Red army does not play the most\nimportant part in the victories of the\nBolsheviki, but that it is only strong\nmainly because of the weakness of the\nenemy. Or, to put it more exactly, the\nRed army begins to achieve victories\nonly at the moment when the opposing\ntroops begin to get demoralized. This\nhappened also on the front of General\nDenikine, where the abandonment of\nthe front lines by great masses of the\nCossacks played a most fateful part\nfor the vounteer army.\n\"General Wrangel has succeeded in\naverting the possibility of similar dan?\nger to his own army. His troops, re?\norganized by him, are so strong in mo?\nrale and discipline that they are al?\nready gaining considerable victories\nover the Red cavalry, those picked\ntroops of the Red army which defeated\nthe Poles.\"\nRed Forces Strike at\nWrangel Army Flanks\nCONSTANTINOPLE, Aug. 10 (By The\nAssocated Press) (Delay?-d).?Bolshe?\nvik forces in southern Russia are strik?\ning at the extreme flanks of Gene-ral\nBaron Wrangel's^ army north of the\nCrimean peninsula, according to dis?\npatches received in this city.\nThree Soviet divisions, totaling 6,000\nmen, crossed the Dnieper River on Au?\ngust 7 at Alushki, almost directly\nacross from the city of Kherson, and\nadvanced several ^ersts southward.\n; Two Bolshevik cavalry columns, sup\nported by infantry, arc advancing\n?southward from Aloxandrovsk along\nthe west aide of the railway leading I\nnouth of Crimea.

She operates between\nGenoa, Naples and New York. During\nthe war she was converted into a\nfreighter, but recently was reconverted\nfor the passenger trade. Her crew be?\ncame suspicious when they discovered\nthat her first stop was to be Danzig,\nand when they learned that all the\naccommodations of the ship had been\nreserved for 800 men, all of them Poles,\nthey promptly quit their jobs. Leaders\nof the crew maintain they had a right\nto do so in accordance with the pro?\nvisions of the La Follette seamen's act.\nFollowing their refusal to man the\nship, the crew applied to the British\nAnchor Line for transportation home\nand living expenses here while await?\ning such transportation. The company\ndeclined to accede to this demand,\nwhereupon the crew brought the mat?\nter to the attention of the Italian Con?\nsulate in this city. The consulate\nurged them to return to their ship.\nThe crew refused.\nThe officers of the ship, unable to\nmuster another crew, then offered to\ndrop the proposed trip to Poland.

It was\ngiven in honor of Thomas E.\nWilson, president of the com?\npany, who recently returned\nfrom Europe, where he visited\nhis branch offices there. He\nmade a special trip from Chi?\ncago to fraternize with his fel\njow-workers in New York.\nThe New York Fellowship Club\nhas an active membership and\nthe members are very proud of\nit so they wanted to show Mr.\nWilson how it measures up\nalongside of the other Fellow?\nship Clubs that exist in other\nplants around the country.\nBut most of all, they wanted to\n6how Mr. Wilson how much\nthey appreciate his efforts in\ngrouping his 25,000 workers into\none big, happy family, where all\nshare in the generous distribu?\ntion of good-will, rewards and\nprivileges.\nI think it is great that one man\nhas the power and ability to lead\nso many people into pleasant\npaths and make them proud in\nhis leadership.\nThe evening party opened vdtth\na performance by a minstrel\ntroupe composed of workers,\nwhose singing and acting and\nconversation delighted the mem?\nbers and their wives who were\npresent. After this part of the\nprogram had been carried out\nMr. Wilson was introduced, and\nthe cheers that greeted him cer?\ntified to his popularity among his\nfellow-workers.\nIt is easy enough to detect the dif?\nference between a genuine and a\nforced ovation; one is spontaneous;\nthe other shows it is given because\nit is expected.\nWhen, however, hundreds of men\nand women stand and cheer and\napplaud and wave handkerchiefs?\nand do so impulsively and rieart\nfully?then there is no doubt about\nthe spontaneity of it, nor is there,\nany doubt about their liking and\nhonoring the man.\nMr. Wilson talked to them very\nbriefly, but he said what was in his\nheart to say, and he said it so sin?\ncerely that his fellow-workers knew\nthat he meant every word.\nThe secret of Mr. Wilson's success\nin his great business of supplying\npcoDle with his company's CERTI?\nFIED FOOD PRODUCTS?such\ncs hams and bacon, canned meats,\nvegetables and table delicacies?all\nbacked up also by the slogan \"THE\nWILSON LABEL PROTECTS\nYOUR TABLE\" ?is due to the\nfaith he has in his fellow-workers\nand to their faith in him. He says\nbo?they say so?and that's all there\nis to it?except, of course, that all\nfeel their responsibility in the prep?\naration of the Wilson & Co. prod?\nucts just the same as they feel\nbound in honor to play on the level\nwith one another.\nIt Is out of the question for people living\nIn the same household to act true-blue In\none direction and false in another?and In\nth..? particular household, don't forget,\nthfre is absolute harmony as affecting the\nspirit, the thoughts and the action of\nevery member thereof.\nMr. Wilson remained with his fellow\nnorkcr? .?s one of the liveliest and most\nagreeable members of the party until the\nevening's gaieties ended.\nAnd so goe3 along merrily and happily the\nbuilding of a great organization in mat?\nter? more important than mero cold busi?\nngs? calculations.\nSincerely yours, William C.

Stevenson, chief investi?\ngator of the( Lusk Committee investi?\ngating Bolshevism In New York, said\nyesterday he was confident the finan?\ncial ramifications of the Russian soviet\nheadquarters in this city under the\ndirection of Ludwig C. K. A. Martens\nwould be uncovered shortly. The bu?\nreau has been reported to have re?\nsources of $200,000,000.\nSenator Clayton R. Lusk, chairman\nof the committee, says all the commit?\ntee desires is the truth about seditious\nactivities on the part of any and all\nageneies seeking to evade or upset, the\nlaws of the land, either in New York or\n| any other city of the state.\nProfessor Alessandro Carasso, Ph.D.,\nof 190 South Oxford Street, Brooklyn,\nwho says he has worked as an inter?\npreter for the Lusk Committee, yester?\nday announced his resignation, saying\nthe work of the committee is misdi?\nrected , that the investigators are not\ncompetent, and that one of the things\ncertain to happen is retribution on the\npart of the Bolsheviki in Russia against\nAmericans still over there. His wife\nand daughter are in Russia, he says,\nand he fears for their safety.\nCriticises Lusk and Aids\nProfessor Carasso says that while\nhe was in Petrograd he was attached\nto the American Embassy; that he is\na graduate of the Universities of Mos?\ncow and Geneva, and that he has spent\nmany years in Russia. He likens Bol?\nshevism to a fad, in which he said\nmany here are indulging. He criticized\nSenator Lusk and his colleagues, say?\ning they were ignorant of the subject\n[ they were pursuing.\n\"About a month ago I was invited\n?.by the committee to act as interpre\nj ter,\" said he. \"I accepted because the\nwork accorded with my anti-Bol\n' shevist principles. When I became\nmore intimately acquainted with my\ncolleagues I felt ashamed for myself,\nfor them and for those investing them\n; with authority. These were persons\n? lacking knowledge of the profound is\n! sues involved.\n\"I am not opposed to the prosecu\n: tion of Bolshevism; on the contrary\nj I am in favor of the entire suppression\nj of this falsehood. Residing in Russia\n; for a decade and being one of the\ni last Americans to leave the country,\nI I was able to view thoroughly the\nI brutality which Bolshevism developed\n| there?robbery, murder, rape and\n! 'fieedom celebrating' oppression?all\n; these I saw. None can therefore favor\nI with more enthusiasm than myself the\n! vigorous prosecution, if not destruc?\ntion, of this brutal movement.\nForesees Harmful Resnlts\n\"I cannot sympathize, nevertheless,\nwith the means taken by certain pri\n! vate persons under the cloak of local\n: legislation to combat this serious\nJ menace.\n\"What results do you think will be\n! achieved by the raid on the soviet\nheadquarters?\"\n\"No result that will be good. Of\nthat I am certain. In fact, I am posi?\ntive this step will prove harmful to\n? our own interests.\n\"The unfortunate Aznerican citizens\nwho are festering i. that Bolshevik\n! hell over there in F?i?ia will have to\npay too dear a price Lv; this imprudent\n? step.

If the Bolsheviki\n! have attained perfection in anything\nit is in the fine art of retribution. No\nmatter what the cause, the fact re?\nmains that Martens was sent here by\nthe de facto rulers of Russia as their\nrepresentative. If it was not our in?\ntention to recognize this government, it\nwas incumbent upon us to refuse per?\nmission for Martens to enter the coun?\ntry. Since the State Department was\n! delinquent in this respect, its rightful\n? remedy is to deport this Bolshevik em?\nbassy in an official manner, and not\nleave it to the clownish hands of pri?\nvate individuals, who then react un?\nfavorably uppn their fellow citizens.\"\nNo Reply to Criticism\nNeither Senator Lusk nor Attorney\nGeneral Newton nor Mr. .Stevenson, of\n: the Lusk committee, had any reply to\ni the criticisms of Professor Carasso. It\nj will be recalled that Santeri Nuorteva,\n; secretary of the Russian Soviet Re\n\\ public, who was summoned to the City\n| Hall last week when the agency in the\nj World Tower Building was raided, said\nthat \"they (meaning the Lusk commit\n! tec) will find that two can play at\n| that game.\"\nI When Professor Carasso was asked\nI about a so-called \"retribution list,\"\n'? containing the names of the Lusk com\n: mitteo and others, which it was said\ni had been obtained in the raid, he said\n? last night that he had not said that\nhe had seen the list.\n\"I am sure there is such a list, but\nI have not seen it,\" said he.\nMr. Stevenson and a force of assis?\ntants were busy yesterday at the St.\nj George Hotel going over the mass of\nletters and documents taken in the raid\nlast week, with the idea of returning\neverything that has no direct or in?\ndirect bearing on the quest of the com\n? mittec, which is uncovering seditious\nactivity. Mr. Stevenson has given spe\n. cial attention to looking up the finan\n, cial connections of the Martens head?\nquarter?, and it is understood that with\nthe help of the government, he will be\nable to spread upon the record on\nThursday of next week a fairly full\ndescription of the means used by the\nLcnine-Trotzky government in Moscow\n' and Petrograd to forward money to\nthis country. The testimony on Thurs?\nday showed that while Mr. Martens\nhad deposited about $14,000 in two\n| month?, with which to run his agency,\n; his deposits were invariably in cur\ni rcr.cy, with nothing to indicate the\nI channel used in getting the money to\nhim.\nMartens Denies\nRed Propaganda\nLudwig G, A. K. Martens, unrecog?\nnized envoy of L?nine and Trotsky to\ntho United Stater., In his first public\ngpeech since the Lusk Legislative Com?\nmittee caused the New York Russian\nSoviet bureau to be raided, denied last\nnight at Madison Square Garden that\n; his American mission had aught to do\ni with spreading Bolshevist propaganda\n?in this country.\nBefore an audience of 4,000 Russians,\nI Letts, Ukrainians and Poles, who mani\nfcsted indignation over the Lusk com?\nmittee's raid, the \"ambasador from\nPetrograd\" declared he waB solely con?\ncerned With the endeavor to establish\ndiplomatic and trade relations between\nSoviet Russia and America.\nThe meeting was held under the aus\nices of the Russian Federation of the\nocialist party, a \"left wing\" organiza?\ntion recently suspended by the party's\nNational Executive Committee. It was\ni called to protest against the Lusk raid\nand against recognition by the United\nStates of the Omsk government of\nAdmiral Kolchak.\nFriend of Trotzky Speaks\nFormer Assemblyman Benjamin Git\nlow presided. The speakers, besides\nMartens, were John Reed, Max East?\nman, C. E. Rutherberg, leader of the\n\"left wingers\" in Cleveland and re?\ncently released after serving a jail sen?\ntence for violation of the espionage\nact; Dennis E. Batt, of Michigan; Louis\nC. Fraina, of Boston, personal friend of\nLeon Trotzky and editor of \"The Revo?\nlutionary Age,\" and James Larkin, Irish\nlabor agitator. ?\nThe audience sang revolutionary\nsongs in English, Russian and other\nlanguages. Various radical publica?\ntions were on sale.\nMartens charged the New York\nnewspapers with conducting a \"cam?\npaign of slander\" against him and said\nthe Lusk committee was \"unfair and\nunjust\" in giving out the impression\nthat L?nine and Trotzky had sent him\nto the United States to disseminate\nBolshevist doctrines.\n\"Our bureau is being incessantly at?\ntacked by the bourgeois press,\" he\nsaid, \"and at this particular time by a\nlegislative committee of the state of\nNew York on the alleged grounds that\nthe bureau is propagating Bolshevism\nin the United States.

J. Prokop.\nThe most striking characteristic of Bolshevism\ns the panicky fear it produces among all the non\nassential proiessionals and nonproductive classes\naf people. As a contrast to this effect upon the\naonesential and idle class of people stands the\nfriendly support it receives among the bulk of es\nsential workers and wealth producers of all Na\ntions who, either by study of communist doctrine\nr by close contact with its principles at work, see\nin it the only means of solving the present chaotic\nwodition of anarchy in production, which is not\naalculated for the benefit of the whole Nation, but\nsimply for the profit of a few individuals, and\nirance leads to the destitution of a great majority\nf workers.\nThat al! those who thus get acquainted with the\nbolshevik principles of soviets-at-work clamor for\nit is demonstrated by the examplary solidarity of\nSoviet Russia under bolshevik leadership, and its\nsteadfast support by the workers of other coun\ntries. Thus we have to accept that from the stand\npoint of the workers. The Soviet form\nis considered to be the best system of\ngovernment ever devised and put into\npractical operation for, by, and through the.\nmasses. Therefore the attempt of the nonessential\nprofessionals and nonproductive, wealthy classes\nto uppress this bolshevist movement of hundreds\nf millions of wealth-producing workers, by force\nf militarism, looks to be a tremendous task.\nWhat Successful Intervention Requires.\nIt would require a permanent standing army com\nposed of black mercenaries, cossacks of old czarish\n?ualityr ignorant Japanese and Turks. Disregard\ning a few professional rowdies and hoodlums, the\nAmerican, French and British workers would find\nit deep beneath their dignity to lend themselves as\ntools of the international capitalist clique for such\na dirty job as enforcing wage-slavery upon the\nworkers of Europe.\nAmerican troops are chiefly composed of wagd\ntarners and small business men. Both of these\nclasses, in times of peace, are exposed to the\nexploitation and oppression of the same big busin\ness which now so ardently recommends the\npolicing of Europe by the Allied troops ; the same\nbig business, that through its press, incites the\nignorant people against the Soviets. But the small\nAmerican business men, whom only the dread of\nlife-long wage-slavevy drove to business careers,\nrealize that the nucleus of common evil resides in\nthe power that the few- \"nothing-doers\" derive\nfrom the old and outlived conceptions of \"right and\norder\" which have now become intorable and which\nwe, like our brothers in Europe, must change.\nTaken from this point of view, the result is that\nthe American soldiers will favor and may support\nthe emancipating movement of the European work\ners. Would Mean Civil War At Home.\nBut even if we could examine the future in the\nmost unfavorable light, we can see that a success\nful meddling into internal affairs of the Workers'\nRepublics would require, first of all, the autocratic\nimposition of mass militarism of the blackest type,\nwhich is impossible without a serious opposition\nand contant clashes between the military and civi\nlian elements at home.\nThis in turn would paralyze production and com\nmerce so seriously that no sane man would find it\nprofitable. Coupling this with the desperate op\nposition the working class of Europe would put up\nin concert with Soviet Russia, the consequences\nlook too horrible for any picturization. Only a\nmadman can recommend intervention. But the\nbourgeois rulers of the world are indeed madmen\nand when they set out on this impossible undertak\ning they only seal their own doom.\nMore than 52 per cent of all the workers in\nthe steel industry labor 12 HOURS A DAY. More\nthan 26 per cent are SLAVES SEVEN DAYS A\nWEEK ! More than 66 per cent of all the employ\nees of the steel and iron industry earn 5 to 25 per\ncent less than what the government stipulates as\nessential foi !'fe. These two industries afford the\nLARGEST RETURNS to AMERICAN CAPITALISTS!"}, "89": {"url": "https://chroniclingamerica.loc.gov/lccn/sn86086852/1920-06-17/ed-1/seq-6.json", "date": "19200617", "ocr_eng": "6\nPROBLEMS FACING\n' STRICKEN WORLD\nShall Chaos or Reconstruction in\nEurope Follow the Great\nWorld War?\nSOVIETS\u2019 MISUSE OF POWER\nConditions in Russia Under That Form\nOf Government Not of a Sort to\nCommend Themselves to\nThinking Men.\nArticle XXVII.\nBy FRANK COMERFORD.\nSoviet government has been a costly\nexperiment. Russia is almost suc\ncumbing to the treatment; notwith\nstanding the \u201cRed\u201d army is meeting\nwith success on the field, back of the\narmy conditions in Russia are grow\ning from had to worse. The soviet\nleaders are drunk with power and they\nhave conducted themselves as drunken\nmen generally do. Reckless waste, in\ntolerant officiousness, greed for spoils,\nare the record they have made. The\npolitical machine Is the same plunder\ning graft organization under com\nmunism in Russia that It Is under\ndemocracy in other countries. The\nsoviet government is a political ma\nchine, and communism has not\nchanged Its character or its methods.\nIt has simply given It larger oppor\ntunities for spoils. Greater security\nin its corruption.\nThe \u201cSoclalderaocratln\u201d prints some\nInteresting extracts from the bolshevik\nbudget for 1919.\nAccording to this newspaper, the\nrevenue for the first half of 1910\namounted to 20,250,000,000 rubles, and\nthe expenditures to 50,703.000,000 ru\nbles, so that the deficit for the first six\nmonths of 1919 of soviet Russia\namounted to the enormous sum of over\n80,000,000,000 rubles. The acquisition\nof foodstuffs and necessaries of life\nlias cost a deficit of five billion rubles,\nand the railways four and a half bil\nlion rubles; thus a half year of bol\nshevik rule cost more than the total\noutlay on the whole war.\nMoney Expended Recklessly.\nThe report of the bolshevik, Nemen\nsky, on the audit of the central soviet\ncommission In charge of all textile fac\ntories, appeared in the \u201cSovletskaya\nEkonomlcheskaya Zhizn\u201d of February\n25, 3010: \u201cThe finance credit division\nof the central soviet commission re\nceived up to February 1, 1919, 3,400,-\n000,000 rubles. There was no control\nof the expenditure of moneys. Money\nwas advanced to factories immediately\nupon demand and there were cases\nwhen money was forwarded to fac\ntories which did not exist. From July\n1 to December 31, 1918, the central\nsoviet commission advanced on ac\ncount of products, to be received,\n1.348.019.000 rubles. The value of the\ngoods securing these advances re\nceived up to January 1, 1919, was only\n143.710.000 rubles. The negligent way\nof doing business may be particularly\nobserved from the way the central so\nviet commission purchased supplies of\nraw wool. Up to January 1, 1919, only\n129,803 poods of wool was acquired,\nwhereas the annual requirement is fig\nured at 3,500,000 poods.\n\u201cThe tremendous staff of officials\n(about 0.000 persons) employed by the\ncommission are in the majority of\ncases doing nothing useful. It appears\nthat there were on the payroll of this\nInstitution 125 persons who actually\nwere not in the sendee at all, but who\nwere receiving salaries. There were\ncases where the same persons received\nsalaries twice for the same period.\nThe efficiency of the officials is negligi\nble to a striking degree.\u201d\nSuch soviet institutions, Nemensky\nsays at the end of his report, are a\nbeautiful example of deadening bu\nreaucracy and must be liquidated.\nIt. would seem that the idealists in\ncharge of the communist program in\nRussia are experts in \u201cgraft-ring\u201d\nmethods. Payroll padding is among\ntheir accomplishments. An innocent\nbystander might suspect some of these\nsoviet officials of having a leaning\ntoward private property, particularly\nwhen it is in easy reach.\nTheir Own Condemnation.\nProbably it is fair to the bolsheviks\nto state their case In their own words.\nThe bulletki of the central executive\ncommittee of the soviets, No. 15, 1919,\nannounces: \u201cWe have created ex\ntraordinary commissaries and extraor\ndinary commissions without number.\nAll of these are. to a lesser or greater\ndegree, only mischief-makers.\n\u201cThe toiling population see in the\nsquandering of money right and left\nby the ooinmissaries and in their in\ndecent loudness and profanity during\ntheir trips through the district, the\ncomplete absence of party discipline.\u201d\nPeople\u2019s Commissar Lunacharsky,\naccording to the \u201cSevernayna Com\nmima\u201d of March 23, 1919, declared:\n\u201cThe upper stratum of the soviet rule\nIs becoming detached from the masses,\nand the blunders of the communist\nworkers- are becoming more and more\nfrequent. These latter, according to\nstatements by workmen, treat the\nmasses in a high-handed manner and\nare very generous with threats and\nrepressions.\u201d\nThe soviet machine.has had its \u201crun\nIn\u201d with the workers. The factory\ncoAmlttfes have been bulldozed- The\nsoylets have been brutal in their treat\nment of the proletariat.\n\u201cThe struggle between the soviets\nand the committee of factory worker*\nis an ordinary occurrence,\u201d according\nto the bolshevik newspaper \u201cEkon\nomicheskaya Zhfzn\u201d of April, 1910.\nWorkers Denied Right to Strike.\nThe soviets have the whip hand in\ntheir controversy T ~ith the workers;\nthey are the government and the \u201cRed\u201d\narmy backs their decrees. There is a\nfinal court of settlement for all dis\nagreements between the soviets and\nthe workers. It is the \u201cwall\u201d \u2014and the\nfiring squad. The right of strike is\ndenied the workers. Many of those\nwho have dared to strike have paid\nfor It with their lives. The workers\nare without recourse when commanded\nby the soviet. Whether or not they\nwere the slaves of the machines be\nfore communism came, It is certain\nthat they are now the slaves of the\nsoviets. Even as slaves of the ma\nchines and the capitalists who owned\nthe machines, they had the right to\nstrike for their rights. The soviets de\nprived them of this right.\nThe bolshevik Sosnovsky, reporting\non the condition in the Tver province,\nin the \u201cIzvestia\u201d of the provincial so\nviet March 9, 1919, wrote: \u201cThe local\ncommunist soviet workers behaved\nthemselves, with rare exceptions, in a\ndisgusting manner. Misuse of power\nIs going on constantly.\u201d\nThe conduct of the soviet commis\nsaries is a general scandal in Russia.\nTheir conduct is described in No. 12,\nJanuary 18, 1919, of the \u201cIzevestia\u201d of.\nthe provincial soviets: \u201cThe commis\nsaries were going through the Tzar-\nItzin county in sumptuous carriages,\ndriven by three and often by six\nhorses. A great array of adjutants\nand a large suite accompanied these\ncommissaries, and an imposing num\nber of trunks followed along. They\nmade exorbitant demands upon the\ntoiling population, coupled with as\nsaults and brutality; their way of\nsquandering money right and left is\nparticularly characteristic. In some\nhouses the commissaries gambled away\nand spent on intoxicants large suras.\nThe hard-working population looked\nupon these orgies as complete demoral\nization and failure of duty to the\nworld revolution.\u201d\nThese pen pictures of life in Russia\nunder the soviet regime are not fur\nnished by the enemies of bolshevism;\nthey are the complaints of bolshevik\nleaders. Do we need a greater warn\ning of the menace of bolshevism?\n(Copyright, 1920, Western Newspaper Union)\nReorganize Polish Police Force.\nThe British police mission which\nwent to Warsaw under the direction\nof Gen. Sir Nevil Macready, commis\nsioner of the metropolitan police, has\nsubmitted some reform proposals\nwhich the Polish government has\nadopted and which will have the ef\nfect of remodeling the Polish police\nforce after the style of the metropoli\ntan police. The Polish ministry of jus\ntice will co-operate with the British\nmission in carrying out the scheme,\nand it is anticipated that the latter\nwill remain in Poland until reorganiza\ntion has been completed.\nSpain Urged to Cut Exports.\nAn editorial protest against the ex\nportation of shoes, leather, foodstuffs,\ncotton and linen is published by Im\nparclal, Madrid. The newspaper gives\nstatistics to show that while the ex\nportation of slices and leather from\nJanuary to July, 1918, amounted to\n13,000.000 pesetas, during the same\nperiod in 1919 exportation of these ar\nticles reached a value of 72,000,000\npesetas. The exportation of other raw\nmaterials also increased greatly. The\nImparcial saj T s this has been the cause\nof the large increases in the cost of\nliving.\nClemenceau Drops War Duties.\nPremier Clemenceau declared in an\nInterview that he could not continue\nto represent the department of war\nIn the chamber of deputies, adding\nthat \u201cafter the effort of the last year\nI would be loath to start again on a\ntask with a fear that my strength fail\nme befoie it could be completed.\u201d\n\u201cEverything is not finished with our\nvictory,\u201d he continued. \u201cWe must still\naccomplish formidable work, demand\ning patience for which France may\nbe incapable. I will always have a\nduty to perform, though I have ceased\nto be a member of parliament.\u201d\nBelgium Buckles to Her Task.\nBelgium is manfully grappling with\nthe great problem of domestic recon\nstruction. Like practically every other\ncountry she is faced with a tremen\ndous shortage of houses, besides her\nown great devastated areas which\nmust in some way be rehabilitated.\nEvery day, however, the \"work must be\ncome easier, and with a people so re\nmarkably determined to secure unity\namongst themselves and the maximum\nof effort, a comparatively short time\nought to see Belgium well on the way\nto complete rehabilitation,.\nItaly Urged to Join Russia.\nDeputy Ciccotti, in a speech before\nthe Italian chamber, urged Italy to\nbreak away from the allies and asso\nciate herself with the Russian soviet\ngovernment. This was the first decla\nration of the Italian socialists\u2019 policy\ntoward the allies.\nImmediately after Ciccotti\u2019s speech\nleaders of the Catholic block let it be\nknown that their party has decided\nagainst a parliamentary coalition with\nthe socialists.\n\u201cVillain.\u201d\nThis word has come down to 'us\nfrom Latin through 'the French and\nmeans a very wicked person. In\nRoman times, however, a\n(from \u201cvilla,\u201d a country home of es\ntate) was only a farm servant and\noften a veyy good man.\nTHE DEMOCRAT, MINERAL POINT, WISCONSIN.\nLEGAL NOTICES\nT. M.
