    <p>As word vectors are vectors, they can be compared to each other by calculating their cosine similarity. Cosine similarity measure how closely two vectors point towards each other, on a scale from -1 to 1.</p>
    <p>Cosine similarity can be calculated regardless of the number of dimensions a vector has, meaning that they are a useful way to visualize the relationship between word vectors with 200 dimensions.</p>
    <p>By checking the cosine similarity of select words to the word “Stalin” over the five time periods, we can examine how associations with Stalin changed over time in the American press. Below is a heatmap showing the changes in cosine similarity of ten words over time.</p>

    <p>The ten selected words above work best when considered in pairs:</p>
    <p>Dictator, Dictators: During the first period we see that there is a stronger association between these titles and the word Stalin. During the second and third periods, when the Soviets were allied with the United States, the cosine similarity drops significantly. It then begins to climb back to the original value (dictator especially) in the post war era.</p>
    <p>Premier, Ally: These are both descriptors that do not change signifcantly during the different periods. Premier was a general descriptor for the Soviet head of government and it maintains a moderatly strong association with Stalin. Despite there being multiple period were Stalin was an ally of the US, the word has a weak association that stays weak throughout.</p>
    <p>Mussolini, Hitler: the two leaders of the Axis powers in Europe, both names maintain a strong association with Stalin throughout (and Mussolini is the word with the highest cosine similarity to Stalin in the first time period). Even after the deaths of both Hitler and Mussolini in 1945, the association between these names do not drop.</p>
    <p>Churchill, Roosevelt: In contrast to the Axis powers, the two leaders of the Western Allies initially have a low similarity with Stalin, which grows over time. Roosevelt's peaks around his death in 1945 and then begins to decline again, while Churchill's association continues to grow, and the highest similarity between the two occurs in the last time period.</p>
    <p>Lenin, Tito: Two communist leaders whose legacies are tied to Stalin. Lenin, Stalin's predecessor, maintains a strong association which peaks during the middle part of the war. Tito initially begins with a very weak associations, which sees a metoric rise during his consolidation of power in Yugoslavia. By the final time period Tito has the highest cosine similarity with Stalin of any word.</p>
    <h5 class="w3-padding-16"><span class="w3-tag w3-wide">Observations</span></h5>
    <p>Comparing the results of each word, one can draw a number of hypothesizes as to why. For example, the dip in cosine similarity for "Stalin" and "dictator/dictators" corresponds during the war years where the Soviet Union was an ally of the United States. This suggests that American newspapers were less inclined to associate Stalin with such negative terms when he was an ally. Take also the increasing association with Tito. Once Tito had full control over Yugoslavia, he increasingly butt heads with Stalin over the direction of the Communist ideology in Europe. The most dramatic events of this split occured between 1948 and 1953 - one could draw the conclusion that the cosine similiarity between the two is so high because the American public was fascinated with this growing fracture in the Communist bloc.</p>
    <p>Due to the black box nature of a neural network, however, one cannot go much farther than a hypothesis with just this information. The underlying dimensions in each word vector do not explicitly represent semantic concepts; they are just areas of relevance that Word2Vec identified while it trained. Similarly, the Word2Vec model does not know anything about the sources used to train it, and cannot provide further information about the articles that led to a word being trained in the way that it was.</p>
