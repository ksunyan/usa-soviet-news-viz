    <h5 class="w3-padding-16"><span class="w3-tag w3-wide">Word Vectors</span></h5>
    <p>In Natural Language Processing (or NLP), a word vector is a mathematical representation of a word's meaning. A word vector is made up of an arbitrary number of dimensions, where each dimension represents some semantic quality of the word. A word is assigned a value in each of these dimensions, creating the word vector. This approach allows for two word vectors to be quantitatively examined for how similar they are to each other, semantically speaking. For example, in a given set of word vectors, imagine that the word vectors for King and Queen are much closer in value than the word vector for apple. We can conclude that King and Queen have some semantic similarities (they are titles, terms for royalty, references to people, etc.) which apple does not.</p>
    <p>Word vectors are generated by NLP models, which take a corpus of text as an input and output a list of word vectors for each unique word in the corpus. These models are boradly referred to as Word2Vec. The specific implementation used in this research is a shallow neural network trained by an algorithm known as skip-gram, which is used to determine the most related words to a certain word. Given the initial corpus of text and a number of dimensions, Word2Vec generates values for each word for each dimensions and outputs the aforementioned list.</p>
    <p>As word vectors are vectors, they can be compared to each other by calculating their cosine similarity. Cosine similarity measure how closely two vectors point towards each other, on a scale from -1 to 1; a value of -1 means they point in opposite directions, 0 means they are orthagonal, and 1 means they point in the same directions. Cosine similarity can be calculated regardless of the number of dimensions a vector has, meaning that they are a useful way to visualize the relationship between word vectors which generally have 100 or more dimensions assigend to them.</p>
    <h5 class="w3-padding-16"><span class="w3-tag w3-wide">Changing Meanings</span></h5>
    <p>The word vectors that Word2Vec outputs will change based on the corpus of text that is inputted. Thus, by carefully selecting what text to use, we can compare the differences in word vectors generated from different corpuses, and draw conclusions as to why. This is an intruiging tool to study something such as history; by dividing text into distinct time periods and creating models from them, we can observe how words change in their associations to eachother over time.</p>
    <p>For this particular research, we are focusing on perceptions of Soviet Premier Josef Stalin. By taking the name Stalin and calculating its cosine similarity with select other words, we can see how their associations changed during the course of the Second World War and the beginning of the Cold War.</p>

    <p>The ten selected words above work best when considered in pairs:</p>
    <p>Dictator, Dictators: During the first period we see that there is a stronger association between these titles and the word Stalin. During the second and third periods, when the Soviets were allied with the United States, the cosine similarity drops significantly. It then begins to climb back to the original value (dictator especially) in the post war era.</p>
    <p>Premier, Ally: These are both descriptors that do not change signifcantly during the different periods. Premier was a general descriptor for the Soviet head of government and it maintains a moderatly strong association with Stalin. Despite there being multiple period were Stalin was an ally of the US, the word has a weak association that stays weak throughout.</p>
    <p>Mussolini, Hitler: the two leaders of the Axis powers in Europe, both names maintain a strong association with Stalin throughout (and Mussolini is the word with the highest cosine similarity to Stalin in the first time period). Even after the deaths of both Hitler and Mussolini in 1945, the association between these names do not drop.</p>
    <p>Churchill, Roosevelt: In contrast to the Axis powers, the two leaders of the Western Allies initially have a low similarity with Stalin, which grows over time. Roosevelt's peaks around his death in 1945 and then begins to decline again, while Churchill's association continues to grow, and the highest similarity between the two occurs in the last time period.</p>
    <p>Lenin, Tito: Two communist leaders whose legacies are tied to Stalin. Lenin, Stalin's predecessor, maintains a strong association which peaks during the middle part of the war. Tito initially begins with a very weak associations, which sees a metoric rise during his consolidation of power in Yugoslavia. By the final time period Tito has the highest cosine similarity with Stalin of any word.</p>
