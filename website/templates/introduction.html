      <h5 class="w3-padding-16"><span class="w3-tag w3-wide">Word Vectors</span></h5>
      <p>In Natural Language Processing (or NLP), a word vector is a mathematical representation of a word's meaning. 
        A word vector is made up of an arbitrary number of dimensions, where each dimension represents some semantic quality 
        of the word. A word is assigned a value in each of these dimensions, creating the word vector. 
        This approach allows for two word vectors to be quantitatively examined for how similar they are to each other, semantically speaking. 
        For example, in a given set of word vectors, imagine that the word vectors for King and Queen are much closer in value than the word vector for apple. 
        We can conclude that King and Queen have some semantic similarities (they are titles, terms for royalty, references to people, etc.) which apple does not.</p>
      <p>Word vectors are generated by NLP models, which take a corpus of text as an input and output a list of word vectors for each unique word in the corpus. 
        These models are broadly referred to as Word2Vec. </p>
      <h5 class="w3-padding-16"><span class="w3-tag w3-wide">Changing Meanings</span></h5>
      <p>The word vectors that Word2Vec outputs will change based on the corpus of text that is inputted. 
        Thus, by carefully selecting what text to use, we can compare the differences in word vectors generated from 
        different corpuses, and draw conclusions as to why. This is an intruiging tool to study something such as history; 
        by dividing text into distinct time periods and creating models from them, we can observe how words change in their 
        associations to eachother over time.</p>
      <p>This was previously done in the <a href = "http://dh.library.yale.edu/projects/vogue/">Robots Reading Vogue</a> 
        digital humanities lab at Yale. Copies of Vogue magazine were separated into corpuses by decade and the resulting word
         vectors were used to track the changing associations with the word "beauty" over time. </p>
      <p>For this particular project, we are focusing on perceptions of Soviet Premier Josef Stalin.
         By taking the name Stalin and calculating its cosine similarity with select other words, we can see how their 
         associations changed during the course of the Second World War and the beginning of the Cold War.</p>
